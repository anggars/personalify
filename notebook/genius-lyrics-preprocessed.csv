Let's just forget everything said
And everything we did
Best friends and better halves
Goodbyes
And the autumn night when we realized
We were falling out of love

I’ll See You When We’re Both Not So Emotional Lyrics
The seventh song from American Football’s self-titled album. Its title is self-explanatory: it deals with a troubled relationship, in which both parts are too emotional to discuss anything.

If you're so prone
To accidents
And misunderstandings
You may accidentally
Misinterpret honesty
For selfishness

We're two human beings
Individually
With inherent
Interest in
Each other and
How we relate

If you're still prone
To accidents
And misunderstandings
You won't understand me
Or my motivation
For being alone

We're just two human beings

With my nerves exposed, I can't say no

I wanna taste a little bit of everything
But it gets me in trouble
To fill my plate with the vacant and obscene
With my nerves exposed, I can't say no

I'm paralyzed, engaged in a civil war
What can I do?
Either way, I lose
You lose, too

You're chained to me

Home is where the haunt is
Those wounds won't lick themselves
It's a good thing you're not alone
He's been here all along
You can't see him, but you know he's there

The ghost in the corner of the room
He knows what you sleep in
When you're dreaming, of who
Some things never change
Maybe that's okay

Home is where the haunt is
The past still present tense
Need more time to mourn
But you shouldn't sulk for too long
Because you look like hell
An accidental version of yourself

You can't just forget all the other lives you've lived

There's more of you and me
Than a desperate thief could ever set free
Now I'm your burden

Selfishness is inherited
Like skinny lips and tattoos (What could I do?)

I'm sorry for leaving
I'm sorry with one foot out the door
I'm unapologetically sorry for everything

All of your best attributes
Look better on me than they ever did on you
We could be each other's other burden

Selfishness is inherited
So, what could I do? (What could I do?)
I didn't catch it kissing Jenny in the closet
I didn't learn it at school

I'm sorry you need me
For hanging on your arm, a child you can't ignore
I'm unapologetically sorry for everything
I'm sorry for aging
Growing more and more disinterested in celebrity and politic
I'm unapologetically more
Maybe more than anything, sorry you love me

It's been three whole years of me thinking 'bout you every day
Sometimes for hours, sometimes in passing
Saw you from the bottom of the staircase
Stood out for hours as you complained
About how you haven't seen your friends yet
That you're too drunk to stand and
You not knowing if you can love him forever
Bullshit, you fucking miss me
There, I said it, I guess I'll talk to you in a few months
Sitting drunk on the sidewalk
I guess I'll get up, I guess I'll go for a walk
Press my shoes against the pavement
I swear, this has gotta be the hundredth time I've thought of
You tonight

You weren't the only one who thought of us that way
I spend most nights awake, wide awake
I never thought that I, oh, I would see the day
Where I'd just let you go, let you walk away
Where I let you walk away

Used to call you a crook, called you a bandit
There ain't no other good damn reason why
My heart, it would go missing
For so many months, so I was wishing that you
That you would stop pretending
Remember all those countless nights
When I told you I loved you
And to never forget it? Oh, just forget it


You weren't the only one who thought of us that way
I spend most nights awake, wide awake
I never thought that I, oh, I would see the day
Where I'd just let you go, let you walk away
Where I let you walk away

I guess I'll get up, I guess I'll go for a walk
Press my shoes against the pavement
I swear, this has gotta be the hundredth time I've thought of
You tonight
I spend most nights awake, wide awake
I never thought that I, oh, I would see the day
Where I let you walk away
There ain't no other good damn reason why
My heart, it would go missing
That you would stop pretending
Remember all those countless nights
When I told you I loved you
I spend most nights awake, wide awake
I never thought that I, oh, I would see the day
Where I let you walk away
I spend most nights awake, wide awake
I never thought that I, oh, I would see the day
Go ahead and walk away","Türkçe It's been three whole years of me thinking 'bout you every day Sometimes for hours, sometimes in passing Saw you from the bottom of the staircase Stood out for hours as you complained About how you haven't seen your friends yet That you're too drunk to stand and Bullshit, you fucking miss me There, I said it, I guess I'll talk to you in a few months Sitting drunk on the sidewalk I guess I'll get up, I guess I'll go for a walk Press my shoes against the pavement I swear, this has gotta be the hundredth time I've thought of You tonight I spend most nights awake, wide awake I never thought that I, oh, I would see the day Where I let you walk away There ain't no other good damn reason why My heart, it would go missing That you would stop pretending Remember all those countless nights When I told you I loved you I spend most nights awake, wide awake I never thought that I, oh, I would see the day Where I let you walk away I spend most nights awake, wide awake I never thought that I, oh, I would see the day Go ahead and walk away"

Tears Over Beers Lyrics
Tears Over Beers is a song about a girl picking a jock over the average guy (Jake Ewald). This song was released as track 2 on their album Sports.

When I was just a boy
We'll call it fifteen or so
I found myself annoyed
By a syndrome of sorts in my bones
That girl who's next to me
(""Wait, next to— like, right next to—? Oh, God"")
She found herself bored to tears
She realized if she wanted conversation
She's out of luck for three more years

When I moved away from home
One hundred miles or so
I knew a change had grown
Inside my awkwardly long limbs and bones
That girl who's next to me
She's friendly and thoughtful and quite awfully pretty
But all she has to say
Is a meathead-themed monologue on why Brad ran away

She said, ""All I can hope for is for me to get better
'Cause all I can take is no more
I'll win him back again, we'll be lovers, best friends
He won't need no other woman
Like he did way back when he was with me
He needed more than me
I'm friendly and thoughtful and quite awfully pretty
But he needed more than me""


When I felt that I should leave
We'll call it midnight or so
I found myself annoyed
By a syndrome of sorts in her bones
That girl who's next to me
She don't know her worth in this town
'Cause her face starts to shine when that meathead behind me
Is grinning as he's checking her out (""Oh, come on!"")

I said, ""All I can hope for is for you to get better
'Cause all I can take is no more
So I'll hide where I can
Away from you and your friends
Leaking tears over beers once again""
Leaking tears over beers once again
You're leaking tears over beers once again",https://genius.com/Modern-baseball-tears-over-beers-lyrics,"When I was just a boy

Fine, Great Lyrics
The opening track from Modern Baseball’s sophomore LP You’re Gonna Miss It All.

I hate worrying about the future
'Cause all my current problems are based around the past
And I hate when you call me late at night
Just to check in to make sure I got nothing to be sad about
But it's all right, and I'm okay
I won't need your help, anyway, ah, well
I hate having to think about my future
When all I wanna do is worry about everyone but me

I'm so tired, or maybe just bored
I can't really tell the difference whenever I'm talking to you
And I know that you just adore
Starting off with me, that way that there's no way that I'll assume
That you're wasting all of my time
To vent about your problems like how your Instagram stopped working
And how your friends bailed on you
But it was funny 'cause it was the day you were supposed to hang with me
(Yeah, about that)

I'm guilty as charged for leading you on
A lie that I know is easy to see
But it's crucial to blot out any
Signs that I might have feelings
This way, you don't ask me ""how am I?""
This way you won't force me to proceed
With actually having to tell you my worries
With actually having you give a damn about me
You giving a damn about


I hate worrying about the future
'Cause all my fucking problems are based around the past
And I hate when you call me late at night
Just to check in to make sure I got nothing to be sad about
But it's alright, and I'm okay
I won't need your help, anyway, ah, well

Re-Do Lyrics
The first track on Modern Baseball’s debut album deals with a theme very common in emo and pop punk: is life worth living?

I wanna start from the top
Maybe like a do-over
Replace the voices in my head
With blind innocence

I want a complete re-do
Maybe change my name
Report the losses, grab the claim
""It's a shame, it's such a shame""
We're pissing away our time
'Cause we're pissing away these beers
No monumental moment ever came from saying
""Come on, dude, just take one more shot""

Try to, try to forget
That your bones will dismantle
And the dreams you had
They'll collide with time
Your unrequited love for life will surely
Halt that, I'm thinking way too much at night

Maybe I could just move away
Or go extinct like triceratops
But I love loving watching movies
Sitting back, and also breathing
My family and friends would be crushed
But is it enough? (Oh no, it's not enough)
Oh, the future freaks me out,
 
but I guess I could just
Curl up in a ball and think


Try to, try to forget
That your bones will dismantle
And the dreams you had
They'll collide with time
Your unrequited love for life will surely
Halt that, I'm thinking way too much at night

Try to, try to forget (
I won't be breaking any barriers
)
That your bones will dismantle (I'll keep thinking the future, 
the future freaks me out
)
And the dreams you had
They'll collide with time
Your unrequited love for life will surely (I won't judge you if you think the same)
Halt that, I'm thinking way too much at night (So let's keep thinking, ""Well, the future, the future freaks us out"")",https://genius.com/Modern-baseball-re-do-lyrics,"I wanna start from the top

Is he here? Are you making out?
I can hear you guys on the couch
Shut up, make out, do something already, I'm waiting
After reading that text from your friends
I start losing all my confidence
So I'll stay tired, I know soon I'll be bailing

Then you, you ask if I gotta leave
And I wish that I could say no

My head is on the verge of exploding
No amount of aspirin or pizza could help this from hurting
And now, I'm turning to you, scared shitless
Hoping this all goes well
Can we highlight the fact that
My mouth smells like coffee and garlic?
The five cups I had this morning are getting to me
I gotta go, I got the worst fucking spins

Then you, you ask if I gotta leave
And I wish that I could say no
But we're so caught up in the moment
And I just need a second to catch my goddamn breath


Fuck it
To hell with the spins, I'm staying
There's no good reason why I should leave your bed tomorrow
We can watch Planet Earth and brainstorm tattoos
To hell with class, I'm skipping
Let's order food and sleep in
I've got so much to do
But it's okay 'cause whatever, forever

The Weekend Lyrics

Though I seem cool, calm, and collected
Making my way to hipster with glasses
Was a little more than just nerve wrackin'
Kinda just counted on her to turn me into goo

Praise whatever, it ended with a smile
Cause for a bit, a tad, a little while
I expected you two, to save the day with sly remarks
Like ""He's so cute"" and ""Whatever you wants
Though the white jacket didn't fit
The friends I came with did, perfectly
Snugged right to my body
Like sad movies and late-night drinks
Could’ve guessed by the end of the hour
There was more than just a little smile on my face
Covered in custard and cookies and cream
Pissed off I had to leave
But all has to end

You got a smile that could light this town
And we might need it
Cause it gets dark around here
Real dark around here
Most of my old friends
I can only stand for the weekend
But that doesn't apply here
Doesn't apply here


The day started with a bloody drip
And a taste on my lips
That was a lot less than desired
Awkward moments to the side
Not all expiring fast
A tank top that didn't cover a thing
And a zipped down hoodie zipped to the bottom
Had us laughing every time
No matter how many chest hairs there were in sight

You got a smile that could light this town
And we might need it
Cause it gets dark around here
Real dark around here

Didn't watch your ex's set
, I just left and thought about you
Like when your teeth graze those lips and you begin to smile
Later, you took my hand, you led us to the doorway
But you let go of me once you saw all your friends
And I've known you forever, 
at least that's what I tell Jake
When I'm too drunk to walk home, when your brother is away
You suggested I write a song about the first time we met
But I can't seem to remember where or when

Couldn't watch your ex's set, instead, I wrote this song about you
Thought, ""Would you show your kids if you found the time was right?""
You'd tell them where and when
, 
you never thought I'd leave the East Coast
We were young and full of sin
, 
and I too dumb to understand
Yet I've loved you forever, 
at least that's what I tell Holt
And I'm too drunk to lie, too drugged to be alone
You suggested I write a song about the first time we met
Well I don't wanna remember there or then

So, is this the hook you wanted?
Is it stuck inside your head?
Can you sing it with your friends or alone?
So, am I what you needed?
Say you love me to my face
Grin and gossip, walk away, and then go
""So is this the hook you wanted?
To sing about me to my friends?
Well you're just stuck inside your head, all alone
Oh, you were all I needed
Said I loved you to your face
But you just laughed and walked away""",https://genius.com/Modern-baseball-the-thrash-particle-lyrics,"Didn't watch your ex's set

Yeah Yeah Utah Lyrics

What, so I gotta sit here and eat dessert alone like I’m fuckin' Steven Glansberg?

Andy, the highway looked so dark
When the black took control of my eyes
When something made my focus smash
And I'll be back when the rest of it dies

The voice in my head was gone
Every sort of person looked like hell
With their hands in their pockets
And the marks on their scalp

If I get a chance to breathe
If I get a chance to breathe
If I get a chance to breathe
If I get a chance to breathe

I couldn't breathe under all of that weight
And the things that we've seen
With all the dead, with their hats on their chest
And their thoughts in the leaves
I couldn't breathe under all of that weight
And the things that we've seen
With all the dead, with their hats on their chest
And their thoughts in the leaves


I can't breathe

The fossils of my footsteps
Will be unearthed at a far-off date unknown
Impressed in concrete from walking home alone
After walking you home
And the mops of greasy hair
Will romanticize my despair
But they won't know
That I didn't care

I liked the silence
I liked the empty streets
Crawl down 'em on hands and knees in a heartbeat
If I had to
I owe them that, at the very least

The map had faded out
But I could've sworn I noted every stride
I guess the rain hit before the ink could dry
And where I thought I'd be
Was not what I perceived
Assessing the progress
From beneath your sheets


That's why I need the silence
I need the empty streets
Just as bad as they don't need me

Find it hard to believe tonight
In a curiously well-kept house built before I was born
This year, we're gonna stamp out the sorry feeling
Rain on summer vacation
Five blocks from Tasker-Morris Station
Fucked for the ride home if I can't find two bills
To rub together before

Midnight rolls around
I thought you heard me sing your spirit's sound
But you turned in early
Left the TV flickering its staged romance across your face

Said goodbye from the front porch
I always wonder if you're smiling at us or if you're looking away
I'd ask, but either way, I feel sorry for you
Locked your love in a screenshot
They don't work that way
But I've been wishing I could say that I don't
The selfish side likes to think my execution's more
Of an honest one
These artists all cut cloth with underscored conviction
Blacked-out friction
 flies me 
back to Baltimore
 to wait for you
But I'm stuck here, too

Re-Done Lyrics
“Re-Done” is sort of like a sequel to their other song “Re-Do.” “Re-Done” is the 7th track on their first LP Sports. It’s sung by Brendan Lukens.

She said, ""Let's start from the top, just rid of everything""
Like the notes in your pockets, the texts you're always locking
And if it's all the same, 
forget all of those lines
Where you mention my smile
You got a lot of nerve complimenting me
Through choruses and rhyme

But I know how you get
From time to time
'We'll do this and that, oh, travel the map
And maybe just for a while
I thought you were my re-do
You thought you could change my name
I could tell by the look on your face
Whenever I would say—""

But that when I stopped
To listen or care
About anything other than a plan of attack
To get me back to where
You are my re-do
Or at least a pair of eyes that would notice when I
Couldn't conjure words 'cause I thought about it too long



'Cause we all know I lack
In the field of conversing correctly
Without shaking or getting queasy
Not letting my emotions get involved
And on a side note, you stole my heart
Like I stole your hometown lingo
With steady hands and strong (Steady hands and strong)
But now we're down to brass tacks
And we both know it
The odds are in my favor
Though you won't show it

You etched holes in my brain
Deep and, like you
Always too out of reach
To see it clearly
You sank words into my veins
Deep and, like you
Too excited to get them out fully

I know I'm bad with expectations
The ones too large for any moment but I
I can promise expectations
Grounded for this time around
Let's be the last to leave tonight
'Cause I need time to find the courage
To speak my mind, to speak my mind
Oh, hear me out, oh, just this time


They don't think we can make this last
But we got eyes that see past these nights
And we got calloused hands
But these arms aren't tired, at least not yet

They don't think we can make this last
But we got eyes that see past these nights
And we got calloused hands
But these arms aren't tired, at least not yet

They just think we are young with broken hearts
Stomping around every day
So let's stomp around breaking
Young at heart all the way
So let's stomp around breaking
Young at heart all the way",https://genius.com/Modern-baseball-re-done-lyrics,"And if it's all the same,

I'm a waste of time and space
Drifting through my selfish ways
I don't know how I got here
Travel light, endlessly
Distort all reality
I can't say how I got here

I'm a waste of time and space
Meandering, unwanted days
I don't know how I got here
Entering a well-known phase
I scream, ""Get lost, I hate everything""
I can't say how I got here

Still, I can feel the need to change me from the inside
But I can't let anyone know just yet

If it's all the same
It's time to confront this face to face
I'll be with you the whole way
It'll take time, that's fact
I'm not just another face
I'm not just another name
Even if you can't see it now
We're proud of what's to come
And you


I'm a waste of time and space
Slipping past with getaways
I've let the days form weeks, form years
I'm a waste of rock and dirt
Grass and ground and all the earth around me
Around you

But I can't let anyone know just yet

Hours Outside in the Snow Lyrics
“Hours Outside in the Snow” is the 5th song on Modern Baseballs first LP Sports.

I spent all of Christmas Eve fake angry at you for
Who knows what now or then
And you spoke so fast I just sat back
Relaxed and took you all in

I spent all of Christmas Eve trying to get warmer
After standing outside for hours
Knowing at this point I'd be
Lucky to get any sleep
And I'll toss and turn until the early morning
Happily ignoring
That my blue jeans didn't do
A fuckin' thing for me against this cold
Sober or not, I locked everything you sent me
'Cause what's better than seeing
What I'm missing daily?
I guess what I'm trying to say is that

You might run, oh but
I won't hide
, shed an
Ounce of light on my half-
Hopeless life
""Don't let me go back""


And though I'd like to say more
I guess, I'll just duck and cover
Almost praying that you trip over
The cluster of words I laid out before having to leave
But since you've taken the time to read so carefully
Everything I've ever sent
I guess I'll spend the next few lines hoping and wishing
Yet thanking appropriately

You might run, oh but
I won't hide
, shed an
Ounce of light on my half-
Hopeless life
You might run, oh but
I won't hide
, shed an
Ounce of light on my half-
Hopeless life

To Erin
Please read later
'Cause I don't think I have the heart
To let you read this now
But if I had the heart, oh
You know that I know better
This isn't how you say aloud
Oh, say aloud
To Erin
(You might run, oh but)
Please read later
(
I won't hide

'Cause I don't think I have the heart

But if I had the heart, oh
(You might run, oh but)
You know that I know better

(Ounce of light on my half-)
Oh, say aloud:

""So while you're fixing up your bed
So while you’re organizing drawers
Could you just listen to the problems had
With problems of yours?
And what’s that note you’re writing there?
Why are you giving me this back?
This was a gift from when we met
Back when you weren’t so upset""

I called in sick from your funeral
The sight of your body made me feel uncomfortable
I couldn’t recognize your shell

Your branching off had met an end
From all the weight that made you bend
And when you tried to shed your leaves
You pined for warmth as they said
“Your lack of love for your dear self
Is sapping all of us here out!
Trace your roots back to the ground
Work out the knotholes for yourself”

I called in sick from your funeral
The sight of your family made me feel responsible
And I found the notes you left behind
Little hints and helpless cries
Desperate wishing to be over


You said you’re trapped in your body
And getting deeper every day
They diagnosed you born that way
They say it runs in your family
A conscious erasure of class background
Where despair trickles down
Imbalanced chemical crutch
Open up, swallow down
You said “Remember me for me
I need to set my spirit free”

I called in sick from your funeral
I called in sick, I called in sick
Tradition of closure nearly felt impossible
I called in sick, I called in sick
I should have never gave my word to you

Might have learned how to swim
Never taught how to drown

Open the curtains, 
singing birds
Tell me, ""Tear the buildings down""
You felt blessed to receive their pleasant
Sound of things that break
Make you cringe 
inside yourself
There's a child counting stars in their time
Out
 of their day
In the corners of their frame
They're encased in the losing of
A grain of themselves
Pushed against the ebb and flow
Wave goodbye and watch it go

Well, show me the honest, proper way
Disarm predatory gaze
Sucking dry, never satiated
You've been misused
Been rewired, you're short-circuiting now
Just remember when
You'd call me to come
Take a deep breath and then jump
(Whoa-oh-whoa-oh-whoa)
So fragile are bodies, so concave
Work in self-destructive ways
(Whoa-oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh)


You shot from the hip and missed
Detaching from all of this
In physical pictures, you remain
Spiral 'round yourself in figure-eight
I recoil at every new beginning

I searched for a way out, don't we all?
Existentialist recall
Turn in all, all dichotomies and
Truths that I gave
I felt wrong in many ways
Didn't heal, just got harder everyday
And to be still, 
to be passing
 through the throes
In a daze, feeling heavy
Feeling cold in my skin
In my 
hand-me-downs
Wearing everything thin
And the pills that you gave didn't do anything
I just slept for years on end
Fuck!


Well, so, if I call, should I beg?
'Cause I'm desperate here
Couple steps from the edge
I can't seem to burn bright enough
I'm cold and I'm left alone
We're all alone, grab a hold
Know I said to not; what the fuck do I know?
I had a chance to construct something beautiful

I choked, I choked","From Pitchfork: Open the curtains, singing birds Tell me, ""Tear the buildings down"" You felt blessed to receive their pleasant Sound of things that break Make you cringe inside yourself There's a child counting stars in their time Out of their day In the corners of their frame They're encased in the losing of A grain of themselves Pushed against the ebb and flow Wave goodbye and watch it go Well, show me the honest, proper way Disarm predatory gaze Sucking dry, never satiated You've been misused Been rewired, you're short-circuiting now Just remember when You'd call me to come Take a deep breath and then jump (Whoa-oh-whoa-oh-whoa) So fragile are bodies, so concave Work in self-destructive ways (Whoa-oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh) You shot from the hip and missed Detaching from all of this In physical pictures, you remain Spiral 'round yourself in figure-eight I recoil at every new beginning I searched for a way out, don't we all? Existentialist recall Turn in all, all dichotomies and Truths that I gave I felt wrong in many ways Didn't heal, just got harder everyday And to be still, to be passing through the throes In a daze, feeling heavy Feeling cold in my skin In my hand-me-downs Wearing everything thin I just slept for years on end Fuck! Well, so, if I call, should I beg? 'Cause I'm desperate here Couple steps from the edge I can't seem to burn bright enough I'm cold and I'm left alone We're all alone, grab a hold I had a chance to construct something beautiful (Whoa-oh-whoa-oh-whoa) And I choked, I choked I choked, I choked"

Among the Wildflowers Lyrics

You were born on a leap year, fill in the gaps
Spinning gears, keep catching your cracks
Skipping teeth, keep calling you back
Telling stories pretending they're fact
Let me go, too unstable to wane
Chewing wildflowers to numb the pain

Cut the lines, you'll be fine
But if you break when I break, will you carry me away?
Will you fall on your blade just to hear when I'm saying I can't?

You came out, started bruising
Find it tough to admit when you're losing
Oh, what should I think?
Carefully crafted commercial disaster
They take what you're after
To get what they want out of you

Cut the lines, you'll be fine
But if you break when I break, will you carry me away?
Will you fall on your blade just to hear when I'm saying I can't?


Dissociate from touch, you're tilting to pull
The others with you, 
posed Shakespearean skull
We see in different pictures
You play the imperial, stealing the power to waste away
You took the comfort from the lights in her soul
Projected map of the body: it's crass, abject, colonial
You passed; disease presented to you at birth
Held underwater, told to scream your self-worth
It wasn't good enough
Entrust the secrets to the backs of your arms
Killing the self as to protect it from harm

""
What would you do if someone hurt your best friend's feelings to the point where they become insane?""
""I would say something that made 'em stop
Or I'd just text him and try to not let the bully touch them, or anything
Just try to block 'em from doing that, then turn 'em in
If I got punched, it's okay because, it's not okay because
I was tryin' to get the other, other person safe, but I want them safe, 'cause I was only in the middle of it
But I was tryin' to... help somebody not get hurt.""",https://genius.com/The-hotelier-among-the-wildflowers-lyrics,"Spinning gears, keep catching your cracks

You cut your ties, felt better off
Salutations to your son
Awoke to find you heading out
With your white collar undone
You placed a bar, I played a game
To see how low that I could go
We develop mental pictures
And we’re following our fathers down the drain

Do you recall the imagery
From when I drove you away?
Through others’ rose prescription lens
Man, I’m sorry every day
Because we intersect internally
And then we take what we have and we run
And it all starts to unravel
Until we’re less than we were carrying before
Yes, I expected more
[Chorus: Christian Holden, 
Chris Hoffman

Christine Atturio

Wake me, wake me up
Pictures of you smiling in times when I just couldn’t be around
Hold me, hold me up
Count my rings to see how many winters I’ve been stuck here underground
Swore I’d not burn out
Digging through the memories that made you feel alive when you were young
You were right to doubt
Broken since foundations in the structures you were building came undone


Part of your charm was the way you would push me from
All of the traps that I just couldn’t see
Figures the one that was there to have tripped you up
Would be the one that was set there by me
Wish I was there to say goodbye when you went away
Wish I was home, oh, but no place was there
I cut off my arm at the bone in solidarity
Capital teaches that there’s less when you share
And I felt the noose tighten up on your collarbone
And I felt the gun in the small of your back
Engraved in the stone by request and recurse of friends dead
Is, “Tell me again that it’s all in my head”",https://genius.com/The-hotelier-dendron-lyrics,"You cut your ties, felt better off

Well we called off your guard as we entered the yard
To convince you to redirect some of that rage
Because who fed you rocks while they ate their thanksgiving?
And who left you out all alone in their cage?

And when you were a pup, well I watched you so close
You ran straight to the distance allowed by his post
You got kicked, you got choked, phrases crept up your spine
When he said, ""We must keep our bitches in line""
And on his poker nights, says the same of his wife
He's the top dog, pack leader, a true alpha-male
So make no sudden moves, keep your nose from the border
You move fast, you eat last this side of pecking-order

So why don't you come with me? We've got acres with streams
We won't keep you in cages, make you beg for your treats
We won't tell you to heel, though you might need some time to
Dig up those old bones your young self left behind
You said, ""Your offer is nice but here should suffice
Yeah, my younger years were something but that isn't my life
Master's all that I've got, he keeps me having a purpose
Gives me bed, keeps me fed, and I'm just slightly nervous of
What I might do if I were let loose
If I caught that mail car or ate garbage for food
So, as I bare all my teeth
I will ask of you please to just leave.""


Well your heart has spoken
I feel you're already house broken
Well your heart has spoken
I feel you're already house—
Shit!

Well, I made you a hood ornament for an oncoming car
Because your bark might seem bad, but I'll show you the scars
From when the state sent you over to deliver your teeth
To the heels of your kindred, breaking chains from their feet
And then you wipe your hands clean, splash of water, paper napkin
While the parrots sing headlines, we wear the leash like a fashion
Try to take out my claws, expect a visceral reaction
Try to muzzle me up, I'll lash out, I'll bite back and
Keep my options open
For fear of becoming house—",https://genius.com/The-hotelier-housebroken-lyrics,"Christian makes many comments…

The Scope of All of This Rebuilding Lyrics

You cut our ropes, left the umbilical
And now I carry around this weight of broken hope
And I can’t retrace, and I lost my hold
And blame myself 'cause that is all I’ve ever known

And your face shows doubt
When your head feels the wake of the sorrow
Swore to me that you could live without
Then the beg turns to take turns to borrow
Help me down, I just want this out
When you bend, when you break, when you follow
So you cut me out

Then you cut our ropes, left the umbilical
And now I’m lost, and I can’t take this path back home
Send a birthday card, leave a one-way note
I lied, I’m sorry, this isn’t easy, I don’t know

And you’d ask me to
“Open your walls to this”
But I’m scared, fingers broken
And ill-prepared to let this drag out


When you forgot the words to our song
I can't make this better
When you can’t remember names, it's been too long
It fell out of my hands because
When you stopped asking what was wrong
I just wasn't built to hold on
All the pressure built up it was too strong
And I can’t remember names it's been too long
And I can’t find your face in the crowd

I made a promise, said my eyes would stay shut
Through something called the scope of all of this rebuilding
I broke when I entered, displaced from the center
I can’t find my way around this
My wounds healed while my fingers fixed",https://genius.com/The-hotelier-the-scope-of-all-of-this-rebuilding-lyrics,"You cut our ropes, left the umbilical

Life in Drag Lyrics

I tried to keep a steady hand
Tumble blocks, start again
I held your side when you let go
And you came back well-rehearsed in holding your own
A broken seal, 
a past self known
Retrieve my heart from Alamo
I need it here to touch your skin
Reconfigure, deconstruct, and begin

The centers shrunk between your eyes
Sharper corners, broader sides
And I felt weak in woman's wear
Genderfucked, dilated, stuck holding a stare
You taught me how to guard my self
To keep my heart unscathed in health
I think you got carried away
Reached out your hand... it carried you away

Well, 
it's life in drag
Well, it's life in drag
You wore an armor that covered your face
It's life in drag
I wore hands high to show truce and embracing
It's life in drag


Who taught you how to hate 
your self
?
Who forced you to confide in spell?
Mistook 'pathetic' for empathy
Cast a stone at the foe, and the stone hit me

I held your hand in ritual
To show disarming
While you were a weapon inside your self
Inside your body, oh
I can't pretend
I can't conceal my apprehension
When pressed against the callous of your palm
I reconciled, because you couldn't feel me there

And you wore binary like a badge of fucking honor
While I struggled dealing with the loss of yet another

In Framing Lyrics

Well, you fell for
The first option presented of new rebirth
You couldn't see it, but you
Thought you'd believe it, 
since your

Soles cramping up have been swollen and sore
Your new shoes back then just don't fit anymore
You retraced the same shape, cut up and re-sewn
When you felt abandoned, when you felt alone
When you felt alone

And on New Year's
You resolved to make your chaos external
Duress of sickening kinds
A half year blacked-out of my mind
No string traced back to a place-
-Marker alleviate

Erase failed attempts at obstructing machines
Got drained when the crutch became vampiracy
Bit off more than could chew and then swallowed it whole
I choked on your temper when you felt alone
When you felt alone


And the sirens cry loudly
I am reflexive: I cry loudly
You put my picture in framing
Hung forever, left me strangling
Called me, ""Baby,"" 
and with your

Nature reversed
 and our home as our cage
You caved and you asked, ""Is this coming of age?""
As you climbed out the window, your face cold as stone
You lifted the towel, your wrist showed the bone

Held my breath in the ER, I swayed as I stood
I tried to stay steady, 
protect you the best that I could
And you pretended to sleep the entire ride home
But I heard you crying when you felt alone
When you felt alone, 
When you felt alone

You carry an illness
Practically know it by name
It seldom speaks for you
You learned to tune it away
But it wasn’t easy

Was fond of your writing
It allowed me to see into you
You hid behind the similes
Like fractal light in all shades of blue

Two Deliverances Lyrics
The icons cluttering your bureau
Are eyeing me as I walk in
Your guardians are present in here
And I trust that they have always been
Hiding somewhere in your closet
Collecting moisture from your face
Your secret world speaks without words
And I feel clumsy and cumbersome in this place
But if I want them too, will they speak to me soon
In a language ripe for my listening?
When the harsh sun breaks in your 
stained glass eyes
The refracted light keeps glistening
A drapery of clashing fabrics
In every corner of your room
They hung like lace on the whitewashed face
Of the walls that are begging you to move
And leave the things that hold a history
As if they're present in your will
A brand new place a few miles away
But I just wasn't sure I was staying still
But if you choose this too, it's an honest move
And I guess that it makes for no deferences
There's a gleam of blue from a cold night's moon
Just a touch too soon, two deliverances

On an empty panel floor I lie here
For communion just waiting for one more
But in the quiet empty hours of my afternoon
What am I supposed to do? What was I supposed to do?
But if I want them to, will they come to me soon?
Will they fluctuate between midnight and past noon?
Was kind of banking on a future that'd be involving you
But I couldn't ask this of you, I couldn't ask that
In this young night's sky there are pinhole lights
Find the shape of a harp and an arrowhead
Do I hear your tunes or acknowledge wounds
That I got from rubbing elbows with a sharpened edge?
But if I choose this too does it count as my move?
I can't drop my history just to become new
Now I'm swimming through the nothingness and the absolute
But I couldn't ask this of you, I couldn't ask that",https://genius.com/The-hotelier-two-deliverances-lyrics,"The icons cluttering your bureau

Goodness Pt. 2 Lyrics
There is a kind and immediate hushing
There is a setting enveloped in cold
Withered down to our basic components
We are naked, at rest, and alone
And the drone of the open air yawning
Couldn’t help me feel any less small
In these days we will wear the same blanket
In these days we feel nothing at all
When the floor was all littered with pictures
Like the flora was drenched in the thaw
I was grasping to stay in the present
But your negatives flipped what I saw
A little bird from the side of sidewalk

Soft Animal Lyrics

We were cloaked in the awning of night
Or early morning
Through the headboard there’s a flicker of light
And light warning
Sophie’s on the bunk overhead
Reading Mary Oliver
While I lay still in my bed
That’s when I see you there

Fawn, doe, light snow
Make me feel alive
Make me believe that all my selves align
Fawn, doe, light snow
Spots on brown of white
Make me believe that it is all alright

Your soft face pressed to the wilt
First spring sunrise
Standing low on quivering stilts
In attempting to keep you to stay
I am raising no alarm
It is just us two alone
Then I feel a sigh of wind, your raising eyes
The rolling fog that lets you hide
And I can hear the rustling as you go
Oh, go slow


Fawn, doe, light snow
Make me feel alive
Make me believe that I don’t have to die
Fawn, doe, light snow
Spots on brown of white
Make me believe that there’s a God sometimes

The ring around your mother's heart
Grows saccharine then falls apart
And I can hear the rustling as you go
You camouflaged or clearly seen
And nameless in the in-between
And I can hear the rustling as you go
The firing of rifles off
The echo hits you hard enough
And I can hear the rustling as you go
A soft and skittish self inside
Shines golden, opal, chrysolite
And I can feel the rustling as you go
Oh, go slow, a mob of voices harmonize
And tell me that you're not alive
But I can feel the rustling as you go",https://genius.com/The-hotelier-soft-animal-lyrics,"We were cloaked in the awning of night

End of Reel Lyrics
First breath following wakes of the
Palms pressed, brushed on my arm and then
Wave stretched sending me off to descend
Leading me into the bend
Keep pulsing my hand to the beat of you
Shapeless hiss hanging over the
Mixes of midnight and twilight
It passes, dims to make space and suspend
While she's singing her swan song again
It got stuck in my head as the sound of you
In the night, we will celebrate cyclical spin
As we ritually send off the fire at both ends
Yet I'm blanketed, wet with the thought in my head
I don't know what I want what I want's where I've been
The kind of thing that hangs inside a moment
A kiss of good that's temperate and golden
That permeates the surface of the woven
And seeps into the piece of you inside of my head
Goodness, present and hallowed
Is thanking walls of the shallow
Embankments for flowing in over the
Ranks of soldiering messes of
Dayglow blades scorched by hovering halos
Washing away until I don't even cringe at the thought of you

In the light of the day, stabilize and reset
And then burn in the image until I can't forget
And end ceaselessly speaking until Nothing is unsaid
I don't know what I want what I want is where I've been
In the night will you rest your head into my hands
Will you disrupt this pattern from starting again?
If I ask you for Nothing will Nothing there stand?
I don't know what I want, what I want's where I've been
I don't know what I want, what I want's where I've been
I don't know what I want, what I want's where I've been
I don't know what I want, what I want's where I've been
And Oh, the resonant calm comes hard
And hums off the walls of the block uncarved
And it's new, but I don't know what to do
With the sight of you brimming
The sight of you brimming
The sight of you
The sight of you brimming",https://genius.com/The-hotelier-end-of-reel-lyrics,"First breath following wakes of the

Piano Player Lyrics

Inside your room there’s 40 few
Remaining figures of new moons
To curve around your axle heart
In hopes that something new will start
They’re winding down they’re closing ranks
To rest another 30 days
You lay and watch them wax and glow
You hold them in your hand and let them

A kid half my age
Baby’s breath and meadow sage
Clutched in her hands like trophy game
Just like the wild world was tame
Was granted home and tender care
Into an awkward piece of ware
Three-quarters full or quarter-drained
And both adversely sure how long they will

And then the room becomes her shrine

Her fingers dropped like falling rain
The entire room awash with the

You always said that you don't dance
But then a heel turn to a shadow stance
I’m rung like sodden cloth
And the autumn leaves turn over
Across your floor, into the hall
And I've declined into a crawl
And you decompress and fall away
But this floor is raised on beams of trust
And there’s room enough for both of us

Settle the Scar Lyrics
Dizzy, drunk and throwing up
I finally stopped my spinning
I guess I figured you'd show up
With all my old belongings
Saying ""there you go my friend
I'm sure you've saved another""
Collapsing walls around me
I need some brick and mortar
Took a swing at shortened cuts
Made a wrong turn somewhere
Unprepared for fucking up
Should remind me I'm still there
And I am feeling sharpened splinters
Cutting through my center
To hear you as you're coming around again
You've taken pages from a book
You couldn't see your face in
Claimed the author was a crook
In need of illustration
And you were begging me for more
Did you get what you wanted?
The feeling in your fingers
Right back from where you started?

You made a map of how you loved
And drew a perfect circle
I scribbled a Venn diagram
Guess I lost my stable hand
And I am feeling long cold winters
I'm lost and can't remember
The ways to keep myself as warm as then
I owned your name, your body shape
It sits like family, a grateful offering reflected on the lake
New slight of hand will trick my memory
A veil on everything
The paths that you could take
You said you see life in exploding color
Like the flash of stars
Or New England autumn
I should've asked if you could stay
I should've found a way around it
Because now all I see is grey
All trapped in memories that surround it
And in your father's summer home
He squared and framed the question
Collage of newsprint on the wall
Makes me feel cut in sections
And I am shaking off my chagrin
Flaking snow and dead skin
That buried me in all my past mistakes

The caution tape that you’ve wrapped around my brain
Has continued to stay as I’m waiting for a break
Constantly connecting dots
Trying my best, consuming facts
All I’ve learned what’s done is done
And you can not change the past
Helping or hurting?
I am numb
I haven’t felt anything in days
Confusion is key as I am locked inside
Or am I just really gone?

The caution tape wrapped around my brain
Has continued to stay
A constant strain right behind my face
I’m still waiting for a slight break
For a slight break

And I know we’re just different
I know we're just different
Keep drinking from the same cup
It’ll fill you up
It’ll keep you numb
Simplify the motions
Counteract the movements
Don’t think twice because this is love
This is love
This is love


The caution tape wrapped around my brain
Has continued to stay
A constant strain right behind my face
I’m still waiting for a slight break

You are caffeine
In my bloodstream
You are the energy hidden in-between two muscles sleeping
Please don’t wake me up
I miss myself too much

Birdhouse Lyrics

I want to twist your skin
I want to feel it
Just how flexible it is
Maybe someday I will eventually know
Maybe someday
Maybe someday

It’s not as easy as it seems
(It’s not as easy as it seems)
It’s not as easy as it seems
I know it’s hard to let go
(I know it’s hard to let go)
A certain standard you’ve created
And I’ve fallen below
I know it’s hard to let go
(I know it’s hard to let go)
A certain level you’ve created
And how to reach it?
I don’t know

I hope you never let our love descend
Can you please promise me that we will always be friends?
'Cause I
I need this
I need you
And if you ever want to know what it’s like to be alone
Just ask me


I’m the example of a lost human being
Maybe what moved you is what’s moving me
Time heals all wounds sounds so confusing
Maybe what moved you is what’s moving me
(It’s the littlest things)
(It’s the littlest things)

I won’t forget the day
We took off our clothes in the rain
Danced until the morning came
But the memory remains
You were drenched down to the bone
I was so cold yet so warm
A final frail hug on this plateau
Seconds before you had to go

You were drenched down to the bone
I was so cold yet so warm
We went inside and dried out the night
Well, everything is gone but the memory remains
The memory remains

Can't pull me down or slow my pace
I'll never give up on my inner battles

Are out the window

Need to act like windows

Headache Lyrics

Let's turn back the clock
And do this one more time
It’s so hard
Finding a purpose in my emptiness
'Cause I am an icicle
You are the summer heat
A language
That I could barely speak

There is a headache in my head
A pulse in my brain
Nothing will ever change (or erase this)
There’s nothing at all
There’s nothing at all
(Nothing at all)
I prefer this
Weight on my chest
There’s nothing at all
There’s nothing at all

Such slim comfort buried in old pictures
(This couch is not as long as I remember)
This couch is not as long as I remember
A different shape out of place
A different pace
Such sudden news
That my body can’t shake
‘Cause my stomach won’t stomach the taste
Will you hold me like a baby
And tell me the things I need to know?
I never want to be alone


There is a headache in my head
A pulse in my brain
Nothing will ever change (or erase this)
There’s nothing at all
There’s nothing at all
(Nothing at all)

There’s nothing at all
There’s nothing at all

Sundress Lyrics

Sundresses decorate the cabin
You look so beautiful tonight
Everyone's so beautiful tonight
Sundresses decorate the cabin
You look so beautiful tonight
Everyone's so beautiful tonight
Grab my hand, let's dance
Like we used to in high school
These are the golden years
Let's spend them holding beers
One hand on the can
(One hand in your hand)
That's my idea of romance
I love you
At least, I used to
I love you
At least, I used to

Don't be nervous, my love
Just follow your heartstrings
I hope they tug to the rhythm of the beat
Like mine do to me
Sundresses
They decorate the living room like a neon stage
At the happiest place in the world
Until the lights turn off and I wake up


I'll row my boat a million miles west just to brave this rapid current
And meet you up ahead
Separation is a test that I have questioned on behalf
Of what risks are worth taking and what mistakes I can subtract
From this equation
I can't pretend
I'm too goddamn desperate
Just promise me tomorrow we won't regret this

The irony of dehydrating along the sea
I miss you
That will never change
I miss you",https://genius.com/Tiny-moving-parts-sundress-lyrics,"Sundresses decorate the cabin

Dakota Lyrics

I have never been so scared and sad at the same time
I finally will figure out what life truly means when it's all been left behind
I did not know what steps to take after graduating high school
I never knew
Much of anything
The Midwest has blessed me with great friends, and unforgettable relationships
Still hits my head each and everyday
Well, if these bones still hold me up, I'm fine
If I feel this cold still buried in my throat, I guess I'll survive
'Cause it's sad that time turns its back on us, like a wood chipper eating up the lumber
It turns into dust and floats in the air
To prove what we have lost

All of my white shirts have lost their color
I don't wanna go to the store and spend another dollar
All of my white shirts have lost their color
I don't wanna go to the store and spend another dollar
I like the way I dress
As a matter of fact, I
I love for who I am",https://genius.com/Tiny-moving-parts-dakota-lyrics,"I have never been so scared and sad at the same time

Happy Birthday Lyrics

Tired arms
Sweaty palms
Yet I still keep my fingers crossed

I hope you're okay
I hope you're okay
(Fuck!)

I gotta go somewhere far enough away
I've made mistakes
And I am constantly afraid
I think I think too much
I think I think too much
Your hill's too hard to climb
I wish I had the guts
I wish I had the guts
Just enough to get over it

Yet I still keep my fingers crossed
I hope you're okay
A smile can only bend so far before it breaks
And your cover falls apart
I thought I had another chance last year when you left
Well, I was wrong
It's all gone
I was wrong


I think I think too much
I wish I had the guts
Just enough to get over it

Getting stoned in the back of a car
You have no idea where you are
But you're satisfied with life
And you dont think twice of it
Every day you celebrate, celebrate

Medicine Lyrics

I’m bathing in exhaustion
A never-ending train wreck
I swear my legs, they function
But I’m assembled to crawl
I’m heading east of Benson to glorify a casket
Whether it's Swift Falls or St. Paul
I can’t spend another weekend at a funeral
(Funeral)

I'll try again
I need psychologic paralyzing medicine
To forget who I am
Try again
Forever freeze in silence
I need to forget who I am
So I'll try again
(Try again)

I need something symbolic to rupture
I want to seek some unforeseen color
Please get me outside with sunlight
Reflecting off a waterfall
I can’t spend another weekend at a funeral


I'll try again
I need psychologic paralyzing medicine
To forget who I am
Try again
Forever freeze in silence
I need to forget who I am
So I'll try again
I'll try again
Need some medicine
Need some medicine

Will you twist my vision into a perfect blur?
Will you pull me underwater?
Drag me down headfirst?

First of all I am sorry
Disappointment enthusiast
I think I am permanently sick
I just threw up at the thought of being honest
Will the old me ever come back?
My odds unbearably slim
Will you stay for a while and relax
As I gather my consciousness?
You're warm, I'm cold, there's no argument
I shrunk, you grew, I just can't pretend
To be something greater than me
(Ahh-ahh)
To be someone you want me to be
(Ahh-ahh)
To be someone you want me to be
To be someone...

You're the copper, I'm the litter
At the bottom of the wishing well
It looks as if we both have drowned
Warm hand splash comes down on the reach
You'll never mean much to anyone
But you mean the world to me


Out the front door, I watch your body leave
Could you please keep the light on for me?
Could you please keep the light on for me?
Neighbors shout loudly, ""Hey kid, we're so sorry""
Could you please keep the light on for me?
Could you please?
Could you please just touch my hand one more time?
(One! Time!)
So I could feel alive again
(One! Time!)
I blend in the pastel
You shine so bright
I am lost without the light

It was a steep slope
Such a rapid change
I thought I had it right
The thought then washed away
It was a steep slope
Such a rapid change
I dreamt of months of snow, you prayed for days of rain

Feel Alive Lyrics

Let's all dissolve in a blanket
Fade away like smoke off cigarettes
Wonder what it's like on the other side

I wanna feel alive
I wanna feel alive all the time
Every one disappears some day
You've worn out your mourning clothes
Weak stitch, swift bloom to holes
Nothing will hold you close
Everyone
Have you thought about balance?

The idea of your legs standing vs. snapping
I think about it every day
There's only so much strength that could withhold the weight

Let's all dissolve in a blanket
Fade away like smoke off cigarettes
Wonder what it's like on the other side
I wanna feel alive
If I close my eyes, will it reverse the light?
Focus on one thing at a time
Please unwind, please unwind
I want to feel alive


All the time
I want to feel alive
All the time

I must have lost my train of thought
My head derailed before I could even walk
A fight I never knew I fought
A thought I never knew I thought
Broadcast the crawl
Reflective monologue in a situation that doesn't help you
Raw perspective on the story, ""How one became two""
My diaphragm collapsing at the sound of each and every move
I still miss you
(I still miss you)

You place your hand on the glass, try to get through
A mirror is only a mirror if you look into
My diaphragm collapsing at the sound of each and every move
I still miss you

Applause Lyrics

Send applause to your heart strings
Send it
Send it all down

May they strum and feel everything
Another minute passed
Another year I dread
May they strum and feel everything
May they strum and feel everything
Letters will help you
Spring a farewell

Don’t doubt your alphabet
Don’t doubt your alphabet

There’s always anniversaries for moments we refuse belief
And I can’t tell you
How much it hurts to be reminded all the time

Swallow oxygen
Expand and hold it in
All these years have passed
Yet it hurts to be reminded all the time
Applause my lungs, still breathing
Sometimes it’s hard believing
Struggle with every single breath


I wanna give up
I wanna give up

We are the overcast that refused to pass
Every afternoon when the sun left
We are the overcast
Please take me back
I miss the twists
I miss the spins
All I have is the damage

Send it all
I wanna give up

Send it","Send applause to your heart strings Send it Send it all down May they strum and feel everything Another minute passed Another year I dread May they strum and feel everything May they strum and feel everything Letters will help you Spring a farewell Don’t doubt your alphabet Don’t doubt your alphabet There’s always anniversaries for moments we refuse belief And I can’t tell you Swallow oxygen Expand and hold it in All these years have passed Applause my lungs, still breathing Sometimes it’s hard believing Struggle with every single breath I wanna give up I wanna give up We are the overcast that refused to pass Every afternoon when the sun left We are the overcast Please take me back I miss the twists I miss the spins All I have is the damage Send applause to your heart strings Send it Send it all I wanna give up Swallow oxygen Expand and hold it in All these years have passed Applause my lungs, still breathing Sometimes it’s hard believing Struggle with every single breath (It hurts to be reminded) I wanna give up Send applause Send it"

For the Sake of Brevity Lyrics

Listen up cubs, please don't be afraid
This is the worst news I swear I’ll have to say to you
Mom's not here
God took her elsewhere, she's playing with deer
Where the snow is glistening year after year
I swear she's not dead, but she's never coming back again

Antarctica, look what you did to us
Antarctica, look what you did to us
Antarctica, look what you did to us
You fucked it up
And for the sake of brevity, I'll sum this up (I'll sum this up)
You opened my eyes, and closed them at the same time
(You opened my eyes, and closed them at the same time)
You opened my eyes, and closed them at the same time
(You opened my eyes, and closed them at the same time)
You opened up my eyes

Good Enough Lyrics

Nothing’s ever good enough
Nothing’s ever good enough

Nothing's ever good enough
The weather’s never cold enough
To drive me out
Chapter one (Chapter one)
Needs to come
'Cause I have complained all morning
Now I can barely speak
There's a message inside that tells me
I will shed this skin
I’ll break free again

I've been searching for something
To keep me warm
To help me sleep at night
(Come on!)
Is that a reward?
(Come on!)
Is that a reward?
Is that a reward or a necessity?


Unplug the cord
Shuffle the cards
These ties have been tied too tightly
And I can barely breathe
Igloo mountains built high in the backyard
But all I see
All I see is melting

I've been searching for something
To keep me warm
To help me sleep at night
(Come on!)
Is that a reward?
(Come on!)
Is that a reward?
Is that a reward or a necessity?

There's blood on my flannel
Courage in my flask
If we move onward
We'll never look back
There's blood on my flannel
Courage in my flask
If we move onward
We’ll never look back

Stay Warm Lyrics

Let the water freeze on the doorstep
Keep inside all the worries in your head
Stay warm like a sweater on an old man
How do you sleep at night?
I wonder, does the tension leave your bed?
I’ve asked myself this question once or twice
But I can’t comprehend

I just want to be remembered
As the staple that held the pages together
Is this too much to ask for?

I just want to be remembered
Like the weather in the winter
So brisk, so fresh, so strong
Never lose your focus
Your sense of direction
Is this too much to ask for?

I just want to be remembered
Like a flood in the spring
You will find beauty in the act of drowning
You’ll lose your focus
The notes, the purpose
Your sense of direction
You’ve lost your motive


I just want to be remembered
Like the weather in the winter
So brisk, so fresh, so strong
Never lose your focus
Your sense of direction
Is this too much to ask for?

(Tell me)
If these calloused hands
(Tell me)
Brushed the skin on your back
(Tell me)
Would it make you warm and content?
(Tell me)
Or would your spinal cord collapse?
(Tell me)
If these calloused hands
(If these calloused hands)
Brushed the skin on your back
(Tell me)
Would it make you warm and content?
(Would it make you warm?)
Or would your spinal cord collapse?
Would it collapse?


Let the wind chimes get the spotlight
They promise to sing us a lullaby
(If they ever)
If they ever know
We’re listening
They’ll shut our eyes

Scott Pilgrim vs. My GPA Lyrics

It's hard for me to see exactly
Where the hell I went wrong
I never thought I'd see the day
We wouldn't get along
You think I smoke too much
I think your friends all suck
Can't figure out the reason why our parents fight so much
But I've given up on luck
But I'm happy here
I'm happy here

So leave my sweater on the porch
I'll leave your bag under the stairs
Don't go back to our old place
It's probably locked up anyway
I bet it still looks the same as when I ran away that day
It doesn't matter anyway
'Cause I'm
Happy here, yes, I'm
Happy here, I'm
Happy here, I'm

I think it's 'bout time that I warned you, I might cry in front of you
And I don't want you to feel like I'm afraid of the truth
I didn't want you to feel like it was all your fault
But that doesn't mean that I wanted you to feel nothing at all

What do you want me to say when I can't tell you the truth?
But tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to deal with losing you

So what's the point of talking if you're not changing your mind?
It just reminds me of the lying and it's wasting my time
So was it worth it to me
To wait around and then see
If all my love was well-spent?
My nighttime hikes and weekends
You are my best friend
And I don't want this to end

'Cause I'm stuck on you like the smell
Of cigarettes on your flower dress

I want you under my fingernails
I want you in my sleep and in my dreams
I wake up spooning my pillow
Sweaty hands, but please don't tell your friends

Now I'm addicted to cigarettes
At first I didn't let myself inhale
But smoke got through and so did you
And now every burn hole smells like home

And I know it's killing me
But that still won't stop me
'Cause now we smell the same
But you still kill me faster

Because I lie too, guess I'm just like you

But we both know that planning's not my strong suit
I'm sad that I lost you, but I won't chase you
I still don't blame you for making me stall
When I learned how to drive your car
Because your best friends were all too sad to take you to the airport
But I miss you every minute of every day
Tell me, why can't you still make a decision?

Vape Nation Lyrics

Is it so much to ask that you text me back?
I'm so scared of losing touch, I'm forced to ask if you know that
The reason why I try so hard to be nice
Is so no one else will leave me behind
You're right that it's not that hard to tell the ones that you love
How much they mean and how you'd feel if it was them and not us
But I can't make the time in my life to be sad every time you're around me

Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum
Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum
Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum

How did it make you feel to know you're not quite enough?
For someone who took so much from you and then just gave up
On the things that used to make me so glad, I was the one holding your hand
'Cause I'm not too busy, I'm just still dizzy trying to
Catch my fucking breath through these sweat-soaked sheets
But you're still so pretty and I'm still too skinny to hold
All this weight on my own

Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum
Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum
Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum
Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum
Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum

But I find the time to tell everyone I love
That someday, I won't need them anymore, but that's because
They've given me everything I need to be me
You let me be me

Movember Lyrics

Why you gotta be so fuckin' mean?
Said it's not your scene
Could you just leave me
Alone with my friends?
Alone with my thoughts?
But I often have thoughts that can't be shared and
If you really cared about my health
About my heart
Then you would start
Keeping track of all the times
You said that you were fine but really weren't
It's just like back in time when you were five
The doctor said you would be fine but
It still hurt and I'm still sure
It was just a little trick to make us feel all right

Now I smell like smoke
And I feel like shit
Probably couldn't hurt if we took a dip
Then I'll finally be as clean as I felt back at eighteen

'Cause I'm not getting any younger
My lungs get blacker every day
If I were to grow a beard, stop drinking beer
I fear you might not love me enough to make you stay
I really hope you'll stay


I know I said that it's not your problem
I know I said that it's not your care
This is a problem that can't get fixed
With three drunk texts and one wet kiss
I know I said that it's not your problem
I know I said that it's not your care
This is a problem that can't get fixed
With three drunk texts and one wet kiss

'Cause I'm not getting any younger

Girl Scout Cookies Lyrics
The song title may be a play on the popular cannabis strain, Girl Scout Cookies, following the references to getting high found both on this song and throughout the album.

I know it's not exactly what you're looking for
But that doesn't mean that you can disregard
All of the things that you told me before
I think back to all the times I kissed your hands
And how I can't stand the touch of any other hands
You tell me I should quit, well, I think you should sit
Right there and think about how your words make me feel

Take me back to water breaks and burning insides
Way back when we got high for the very first time
I try so hard not to show how much I like this
'Cause I feel happy again

So take me back
I'll wait

I know it seems like I'm wasting my time away
On things that still don't matter
I don't care who can shotgun faster
But when the goat runs dry, what's left behind
Is someone I don't mind I'm dying with",https://genius.com/Mom-jeans-girl-scout-cookies-lyrics,"I know it's not exactly what you're looking for

Is someone I don't mind I'm dying with",I know it's not exactly what you're looking for But that doesn't mean that you can disregard I think back to all the times I kissed your hands I try so hard not to show how much I like this 'Cause I feel happy again So take me back I'll wait I know it seems like I'm wasting my time away On things that still don't matter I don't care who can shotgun faster Is someone I don't mind I'm dying with

​shred cruz Lyrics

I want to be like Drake and Rihanna
Sitting courtside at your favorite basketball games, holding hands
Eating six-dollar popcorn and yelling at some fucking guy front of me in the stands
'Cause he's too tall and I can't see
And I'm scared 'cause he's way bigger than me
Well, you hate my hair and you hate my pants
Can't understand why I stay up late getting drunk with my friends
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm still fun
Makes me feel like you're not gone
But your room is empty now
And your bed is just a couch
And I just wish that you could get my emails

I wish I could just call you up
And tell you that I miss you
But I'm doing fine, are you alright?
And I, I know it sounds insane, but
You're stuck inside my brain
And all I want is to return
To the safety and comfort of your bed

I like to think that I know some things about myself
But I can't help feeling like a huge douche when I'm around you
Fuck all your friends and their stupid conversations about how it isn't fair to be us
To be young and dumb and sad and scared
And tired and hungry and undervalued and overwhelmed
When all I want to do is smoke some weed and stay in bed",https://genius.com/Mom-jeans-shred-cruz-lyrics,"I want to be like Drake and Rihanna

Danger Can’t Lyrics

I'm getting kind of tired of
All the empty picture frames
Still feels like I'm not quite moved in yet
I'm getting kind of tired of
Facing all my fears
At one time
It's hard to believe that I'll be fine one day

I don't get too far before I waver off
Take as much as I can before I get caught

I'm getting so tired of
Coughing out my lungs
And sticking out my tongue
To catch the breath you stole the day you
Told me this was love
And healed me with your hugs
And made me feel this might just not be doomed to fail so hard

I don't get too far before I waver off
Take as much as I can before I get caught
I'm not scared of dying
I'm just overwhelmed
I love you more than I've ever loved myself
I don't expect anything
Can't get my hopes up too far
Don't text me just to pick up
Call just to cut me off
I'm not scared of dying
I'm just overwhelmed
I love you more than I've ever loved
Myself


And it makes me kind of glad
That you think about me late at night
When you can't sleep
And I'm sorry that you're sad
But I can't do anything for you

Poor Boxer Shorts Lyrics

I'm getting so tired of the inside of my bedroom
Force myself to go outside and get some light
Wear a T-shirt that's not black
Get myself into the shower, stay inside there for an hour
Barely get back home on time, I'm just fine

I'm always double-parked, my car won't start, you ripped my heart out
And it's hurting so bad
But that's all right, I'll be fine if this bleeding won't subside
'Cause it keeps me warm

'Cause it's so hard
To change your clothes
Every morning

So lend me your ears
I'll keep you safe
As long as you let me

'Cause I'm so
Sad
Whenever you're not
Here

​now THIS is podracing Lyrics

So what'll it take for you to see things the way that I do?
Just for a minute so I can be brutally honest with you
About everything I'm still so afraid of
Being there is hard when things eventually fall apart

So would you do it?
If I told you how I felt
Would you stick through it?
When things aren't quite as easy as they once were
'Cause I have a tendency to take on more than I can handle
And you have a tendency to get mad when you're bored
And will you risk your sanity
Plus all the other things you might not end up liking about me?
Will you promise to love me more than you might hate me?

So I'll stay sober
Or at least smoke a little less weed
If you'll live closer to me so I can still sleep at your house
When it's cold and it's dark outside
I've never slept that well in my whole life
And it's nice to not have to try sometimes
'Cause no one's ever made me feel the way that you do
No one's ever made me feel as loved as you do
And nobody else knows me the way that you do
Nobody's ever been this good to me
Not even myself",https://genius.com/Mom-jeans-now-this-is-podracing-lyrics,"About everything I'm still so afraid of

spend
The rest of my dumb fucking life loving you

​near-death fail comp. (must watch until end) Lyrics
Turn off my cell phone, I'm going off the grid
Which for me is eating Cheetos in my bed
Watching movies and drinking chocolate milk alone
I guess it's my antisocial tendencies
That are keeping me from my friends
And the things that could be helping me get by
Oh, but it will get better, they say
Step by step, day by day, inch by inch and play by play
But I'm scared I might not have that kind of time
So what'll you do
When all that you love slowly drifts away from you
And there's no one you can blame except yourself?
When you fall (When you fall)
And you bleed (And you bleed)
Will you need me
To be the one that keeps you operating?
'Cause if so, then I'll get comfortable
So cut the bullshit and show me that you mean it
When you tell me that you'll love me every day until you die
'Cause you're the only thing I need
To help keep me alive for the next few years or so
'Cause you're the meanest
When you know that I need it
And the worst thing that you could ever do to me
Is leave me wondering
If you still love me too",https://genius.com/Mom-jeans-near-death-fail-comp-must-watch-until-end-lyrics,"Watching movies and drinking chocolate milk alone

YIKES (daddy wants wings) Lyrics
Ate four Double-Doubles last night
'Cause Kris said I had to be even with him
My stomach's cramping and we're camping out
In sleeping bags and I miss falling asleep next to you
Turn off the TV
I'm always sleeping
Because that's all I need to do to have fun these days
Because whenever I leave my house
I want to go back inside
Keep feeling nauseous every time I watch the news
Everything makes me sad except spending time with you
There's all these feelings
Building in me
But it's not my place to ever say exactly what I think about
The things I've only ever read about
So I'll stay quiet
Each and every time
I want to be the one you depend on
When you are broken and confused
I want to be the one you rest your head on
When you are tired from walking one too many miles
It's just too windy outside
For me to light this shit
I'm over it again

When the black took control of my eyes

And the marks on their scalp

Cinco de Mayo Shit Show Lyrics

Lately, it's been getting late but I'm not tired
And no thanks to
Sleepless nights spent burning with desire
So I'll get in my car

We drove to the shoreline with the check engine light on
We slept in a spare room, sparing no thoughts for our friends
And we're all going straight to hell for all the lies we tell ourselves

Last night
Last night, I wanted to leave all my friends out
Desperate chance dragged me out of the sand
But chance's a certain way of getting stuck
On one small desperate action robbed me of all my good luck
Why did I think I could make it better now?
Why did I think I could keep my feet on the ground?

If I wake up and accidentally crawl into your arms
It's nothing personal, personhood has always seemed so strange
Why do things always have to go and change?
Be better off if things just stayed the same
If I freak out and crash my fucking car into your house
Of course it's personal, 
personhood has made me feel this way
Why do things always have to go and change?
Be better off if things just stayed the same

Sometimes, I'm awake
Thinkin' about

Headin' towards nothin'

This is human

That something doesn't feel right
And it's sitting in my chest
Feelin' so low

Hope the end of the week
Gets here quick

God Bless Eric Taylor Lyrics


We slept in the mouth of old friends, while
I'm happy living like river kids
We'll be there in our tomby sleep
Going back to the place we left our feet

Could you get some matches?
I'll probably burn them,
 'cause I can't drive
And I need something to pass the time

I don't need any more
I don't need any more

I am waking up all bleary eyed
And I am wondering where I should lie
Because this couch is making my head feel sore
Watching my best friend vomit through the door
Rinsing his mouth out in the sink
Telling me this is the last time we drink
Let's just pass out and forget
Our bodies could use the rest


Come with me
I promise the water is fine
I need something else
To convince me I won't die
Come with me
I promise the water is fine
I need something else
To convince me I won't die
Come with me
I promise the water is fine
I need something else
To convince me I won't die
Come with me
I promise the water is fine
I need something else

...So They Left Me at a Gas Station Lyrics
""Hey,"" I said in my head
You told me to stop talking
My words stayed put obediently
And subsequently I'm tracing
The lines of my spinelessness tonight
I go past all of my half-heart starts
Words that fell apart
I get tangled up in loose-leaf thoughts
Rewrite them 'til they fall
And wallow in the thought
That I might not ever start
Have I been forgotten?
Oh yeah, I've been forgotten
I don't see the silver lining
I give up on trying
Have I been forgotten?
Oh yeah, I've been forgotten
I don't see the silver lining
I give up on trying
Have I been forgotten?
Oh yeah, I've been forgotten
I don't see the silver lining
I give up on trying
Have I been forgotten
Oh yeah, I've been forgotten
I don't see the silver lining
I give up on trying
Now

From pacing to facing
My problems, questions seem to haunt them
My habits, they persist
Constant reminders of my purposeless
I'm insignificant
But I don't remember anymore

I know all this will come to pass
Please god, just make it fast
I watched the door close as you left
And traces filled my head
So maybe
I've got a lot to tell you
Forgive me
I don't know where to start
So maybe
I've got a lot to tell you

Deck Wine Lyrics

Today broke my balance worse than before
My guts are out
, they're crawling on the floor
Give them some help, they're tired and poor
And I can't break what's more than habit, but second nature, it's not my outfit, but how I live
These hospital rooms knew us better than we knew ourselves
Summer death, some are dead
, watching from the bookshelves
The town faded when the smoke quit movin'
Lonely shapes who needed more than big things
It's autumn now, so please forget me
Let me explode, become minimal and disappear
It got so pointless looking for family when no one's here
There's nothing else left to believe
Not even my TV screen
You caught me alone, with tired homes, and withered
Neighbors always getting younger
Dying off, waiting for winter",https://genius.com/Marietta-deck-wine-lyrics,"Today broke my balance worse than before

Fuck, Dantooine is Big Lyrics

""I wanted to ask you something because you're a doctor, right...""
""Yeah""
""I don't like myself sometimes. Can you help me?""
""Barry, I'm a dentist.""

Get to the church light
I need to reaffirm with God
That I'm none of his concern
Leave me in therapy
Maybe someday I'll be okay, (or) fit for release
But don't hold your breath
Misguided notions of what I do best
Come to mind, leading me to see
Nothing except the back of that formal piece of shit
Well I'm done, so convince someone else

They're functionless
Every part of a made up mess
They're functionless
Every part of a made up mess

And if doc says today that I'm not worthless
I bet that I can finally prove it;
Those fingernails are growin' into my skin
Trembling like a headache, I'm awake feelin' nostalgic;
Those pair of lenses know that my head is still talkin'


I hope I sleep tonight
And I hope you keep fiendin'
Over the white and red miserable death pumpin' in your chest
Wasting away any trace of normal blood so the fingers feel drunk
Erasing any prospect that the rest of life will feel less numb

We'll make it out, it's been too many days
We're all fed up inside our graves
We'll make it out, it's been too many days
We're all fed up inside our graves
No we won't, I've tried enough to know we won't
Give it up, I've tried enough so give it up
No we won't, I've tried enough to know we won't
Give it up, I've tried enough so give it up
(We'll make it out, it's been too many days
We're all fed up inside our graves)

I've got my head back
I've got (one-two-three-four)
I've got my head back, again

I'm thinkin' of the time when everyone was yellin' for us to stop being such pests
Andy is outside looking at his insides, and Alex moved out west
When you're alone eatin' your own throat
Does it hurt, this much to laugh?
Talking to yourself and made up names
Telling you ""We'll be right back.""",https://genius.com/Marietta-fuck-dantooine-is-big-lyrics,"""Yeah""

Green Call Her Sims Lyrics
I see you breathing
And you know I'm leaving
But there's nothing harder than saying goodbye
And you won't be speaking
You'll just be leaking all your hopes and dreams and making me think crazy things
So drive Seth, dear God, please drive
(Drive Seth, my God, please drive)
Drive Seth, dear God
(Drive Seth, my God)
Head for the highway
They say it's my way, but I can't stay, so I'm telling myself everything will be okay
(Take back your insecurities because they are boring me)
I'm not worried, just hurry, because it's never seemed so strange
(To death, and I am sick of this sincere shit)
I don't know this place
I don't know this place
We're buried together and staying ahead of the weather
We are so brittle
With bones so fickle
They lie so steady
And now I'm ready to die or drive

Please call someone, we need to find a way home
I'm soaked and can't recognize this bone

Ever is a Long Time (Ever is No Time at All) Lyrics
What's the point in trying
I just fall behind
Spend minutes just to pay
For bleary eyes
Wouldn't you rather die than
Be on my mind
It hurts my head to think
About you dead
But I do it all the time
I could be a soul to keep
Or I could keep on living soullessly
I could be a soul to keep
Or I could keep on living soullessly
Drawing all the curtains
To hide from ghosts
That whisper 'bout the things
We're scared of most
Chain link fences make us feel safe
From shady parts of everything
That I've made real to me
You screamed ""Holy shit""
The wind swept you off your feet
It sure as hell wasn't me
I swear to god it was just
Two nights, a cloud of smoke
Exhaled from my still choking lungs
I couldn't move
I couldn't see
That you're the breath
I couldn't breathe

Shallow breath breathes
Air so heavy
I went down to the bottom of the river
Plant myself in a watery grave
'Cause when I'm down I can't see the surface
Just unknowns and answers I can't see
So I let go of your tiny little fingers
Just to say that I couldn't be saved
'Cause when I'm gone I won't forget a single
Bit of all those long-gone memories
Wait, don't go
I'll 
haunt
 you on my own
Wait, don't go

Are You Afraid of God? No, But I’m Afraid of You Lyrics

And it was cold in Essex County
When the old sat there side by side
Building tombs in the forms of houses
Burying the rest of 
Old Joe
's mind
And I can see him sitting
Aging into the light
Tucked into someplace, Toronto
Saying, why can't you be alive?

And it got cold in Essex County
When he sat next to his grave
Screaming to nothing
If he could have just one more day
And all the drugs didn't help a thing
But fill his knees with epic pain
At the moment, he let out a smile
Because at least he felt something

You wrote me off, I called it funny
Too troublesome, too tongue-in-cheek
I made friends with your distant presence
But by myself all I had was silence
Your cozy glare turned my eyes bloodshot
I missed you most when I could sleep


(I know that my brother is better than he thinks he is)
(Maybe we should call each other)
(And I'll sit atop this train)
(Spread myself out and open the holes in my head)
(Spill out the contents of my brain)
(Give them to Joe to bring him back from the dead)

Give me another bottle, so I don't mash my teeth
I won't be another animal, but maybe that's what I need
Lord knows I've been tryin', but human ain't my thing
Maybe all those pretty 
Ativan
 will feel better inside my skin
[Verse 3: Marietta, 
Choir

Lighting my lighter in my pocket reminding me that I'm here
I hate my lighter in my pocket reminding me that I'm here

Chase, I Hardly Know Ya Lyrics
I screamed at my skin, ""please stay younger""
Where did the years go when I was feeling stronger?
Right out the window when I was driving your car
In the rear view I saw my heart
It spun and landed in the front yard
Of a place I knew before
I knew it, distance crossed my mind
Divides my spirits, half for faith and half for better times
So how long is four years? it's an eternity I suppose
Infinity beckons me to a simple place to hide
Lay down
And cover your eyes so bright from awful morning light
I'm so scared of death, not fond of life
And facing my fears doesn't feel right
So, I'll carry on tonight
Lay down
And draw the blinds, the past is always on my mind
So call me at midnight
Or call me anytime
I'm patiently waiting
The past is on my mind
I memorized the nuances
Of conversation held that night
I memorized every detail of your skin
We were spread so thin

Could've seen you in the basement
Could've seen you in the hall
But it doesn't even matter
Cuz it was nothing at all
Could've seen you in the basement
Could've seen you in the hall
But it doesn't even matter
Cuz it was nothing at all
I've been thinking what you said is true
Our lives are reds and greens and shades of blue
Our colored pasts reveal what is true
Nothing that I said to you paints a pretty portrait of us two
We're different shades of blue",https://genius.com/Marietta-chase-i-hardly-know-ya-lyrics,"I screamed at my skin, ""please stay younger""

We're different shades of blue","I screamed at my skin, ""please stay younger"" In the rear view I saw my heart It spun and landed in the front yard Of a place I knew before I knew it, distance crossed my mind Lay down I'm so scared of death, not fond of life And facing my fears doesn't feel right So, I'll carry on tonight Lay down So call me at midnight Or call me anytime I'm patiently waiting The past is on my mind I memorized the nuances Of conversation held that night I memorized every detail of your skin We were spread so thin Could've seen you in the basement Could've seen you in the hall But it doesn't even matter Cuz it was nothing at all Could've seen you in the basement Could've seen you in the hall But it doesn't even matter Cuz it was nothing at all I've been thinking what you said is true Our colored pasts reveal what is true We're different shades of blue"

O.K., Mom Lyrics

Jake's still outside wasted
And I'm still sulking in basements
With all the drawbacks of inquisition but without the benefits
So pass the liquid courage to this solid coward
And I'll forget every word I said to you in under half an hour
(I'll leave your bedpost by the curb)
Cause there are consequences
To blacking out every Tuesday night
Those words were all wrong all along as her face screams at me
""What gives you the right?""
To reject every prospect
Nothing ever blooms without a seed
I try to break off all ties to delectation
Before they're broken off from me

Occupation; I can't face this fucking tiny room
(How many times do I need to leave early?)
But there was a time I thought I knew what is and is not true
(My head is talking to everyone but myself)
Blindly beside me, I feel guilty about this stupid trend
(I'll poke my eyes out with your bedsprings)
But I guess I just want to accept myself again

Cause when all you've ever known
Is the stagnant void that is your comfort zone
You're not equipped to find
Shriveled reminders of the paradise you left behind


Nothing's easy
And I am lazy
I can't accept another maybe so I'll continue on alone
Continue on alone

I've come full circle almost without hesitation
(But not completely without)
I feel in my bones this shit gnawing at my reputation
(I hate that I do that)
""Just try to feel good about all of this good that you feel.""
(You put it to me bluntly)
But I erase the commonplace practices, I'm practically killed
(My up-bringing brings me down)

""Just try to feel good about all of this good that you feel.""
""Just try to feel good about all of this good that you feel.""
""Just try to feel good about all of this good that you feel.""
""Just try to feel good about all of this good that you feel.""",https://genius.com/Marietta-ok-mom-lyrics,"Jake's still outside wasted

Brains Lyrics

Am I dead? Well if I am, how come I am still a kid?
Warm with piss, I shouted to sis, ""can you make it better with a big kiss?""
Maybe it was the start of this month that has me entirely too fucked up
Or maybe I'm just getting too old, trapped in the back with the rest of the world

Maybe I'm just ancient
To my old friends
Or maybe I'm just making things up
But I don't really think I could

So I'll comb my hair, look at you stare, as I'm ripped apart by a mad bear
I'm not sleeping, I'm not dreaming, so I guess I'm just waiting
For someone to say that it's okay that you had to go away
Cut in two, completely see through, losing control of what's me and you

Just let me slip into the white nice room, that you painted me into
I promise that I won't make any noise or make things worse than they have to

Teach me how to not care about
These tiny feelings that have me up at night for nothing


Maybe I'm just ancient
To all of my friends
Or maybe I'm just making things up
But I hope that I never could",https://genius.com/Marietta-brains-lyrics,"Maybe I'm just ancient

Pony Up!! Lyrics
Come on, come on, these breaths grow thinner
The length of words spent talking about what's wrong, how long, still gone, move on
Blinded by the better parts of new things to come
Left hand-in-hand with life unsettled
Begone from me an everlasting sigh sent skyward, marching on and on and on
Marching ever onward to the beat of my lungs
On and on and on and on
Wish I could sleep until the day is done
Let's not contemplate what follows
It could be today or next year, we're goners
Let me go
Let me go on and on and on and on
Let's not contemplate what follows
It could be today or next year, we're goners
If you can't seem to help but feel the sorrow
Remember that yesterday once was tomorrow
Let me go",https://genius.com/Marietta-pony-up-lyrics,"Come on, come on, these breaths grow thinner

Little League Lyrics

Hey

Hey coffee eyes
You got me coughing up my cookie heart
Making promises to myself
Promises like seeds
Of everything I could be

Hey

Hey Ringwald haze
We're using bruises too loosely
In a haste to lose me
And I've given all I could give
We live in quick flips, slips, tips, and taps
To snap us outta these statue traps
But I've taken all I could take

Hey

Hey Ringwald haze
We're using bruises like Bruce Lee
In a haste to bruise me
And I've given all I could give
I've taken all I could take
I've pushed all that I could push
I've pulled all that I could pull

Fire is motion

My cousin Bucky's so boldly bald
My cousin Bucky never took his hat off
He always kept his hair back
My cousin Bucky kept his hair back
He kept that cap on
Even when swimming
Yeah, I know there's a lesson
In there somewhere
Something nothing

Who smell like salami
And boys who've never apologized

Ooh Do I Love You Lyrics
Mud. Muddy slush. Slushy lawn
In the in-between of the Winter and Spring and the lawn's long gone
People walking, lotsa people walking over the life in the mud on
 the sidewalk under my crawl
Mud bubbles pop and burst breath into the air
Where's the inbetween if everyone's a me
That there tree grew outta me
People talking, lotsa people talking
I'm hurt, you're hurt, my dad's hurt and haven't you learned everyone's hurt
Sure, we're all smiles seeing reptiles and birds in bars
We measure up each species in our heads
Barely aware that we're so scared we measure up each species in our heads
I can step on that li'l fucker's jaw
I can snap him in half like a wishbone
And I think to myself (like I'm always thinking)
I want everything and two of some of this shit
Find my place in the ape house
See myself in their eyes
My fingers on their feet
My possessive love somewhere in their embrace
My freedom's limitations in their swinging and hollering

Forget-me-nots in my gut

In the Clear Lyrics

Canine exhales my steam faced spit bath
Tippy toed
Noses nippy cold touch
I'm looking up through gnarling gashers
Through drooley jowls peering into my peer

Canine ate seven sick five year olds

Baretoothed brawls lost what they unmindedly kick
We shrug and barely bear hug
Grapple down to the ground
It's the same ground grounding us
The same ground grounding those that ground us

(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, lost)

""Time to move on"", they say
I'm sorry, but you gotta go
I'm hoping once I'm a big kid and I look down at the ground
It'll seem further away

Planet Shhh Lyrics
We're being too honest
I push you to pull me
Belittle my little attempts at growth
Go on, Go on
Head right down that headlight's stare
Take my wind and blow it back at me
We've done this before
Halo my middle a hoola hoop hug
Squeeze to warm and ribs stab heart
Halo my middle a hoola hoop hug
Squeeze to warm and ribs stab heart
Halo my middle a hoola hoop hug
Squeeze to warm and ribs
Hey God
I dare you to say it to my face
Hey God
I'll pull you outta the sky and make you 14 again
You'll never say another word about blame
We bit lips
We saucer eyes
I can't shake the shapeless memories every time I read
(And it's never been read)
I'm sassy

Halo my middle a hoola hoop hug
Squeeze to warm and ribs stab heart
Halo my middle a hoola hoop hug
Squeeze to warm and ribs stab heart
Halo my middle a hoola hoop hug

Precious Lyrics
Peanuts and kiddie Molotov cocktails
On a starved stomach
On Sunday afternoons
I've got tobacco allergies
And a bloody tongued cat lick ticking the lil' piggy peeping out of
A size and a half ago shoe
I watch myself in the fishtank mirror in the corner
All the fish died for Friday's fish fry
I'm watching a sunken ship
All the fish died for Friday's fish fry
I'm watching a sunken ship

Tokyo Lyrics
This is how it ended in Tokyo
Buildings rebuilt and billed to anyone dumb enough to be standing there
Thanksgiving day
Tossing, eating, wearing pigskin worn thin
Torn teethly like the scaredy cat sacred custom goes
Sweet chicken little eating lolli pox treats on turkey day
It's salmonella city
Where we're worn thin
Ordered to work in working order
Bashful red shame and bold blue bruising whitey
Hiding in houses looking like aching smiling faces
Comfortable forts we used to build with cushions and blankets
Matching a patched-up pair like us
Apparently, it's a given, given culture and all
We will break things just to call them broken
We are stained by this compulsion to ruin and name it art
Arthur to adults:
""When you get caught between the moon and New York City""
Architects ache so they build
Some subdivisions no matter how much pain or planning
No matter how much it matters
Some ugly houses sprout up in rows
Look like structures of sad accidents and broken happy plans
We named the clever chimp that picked up the first tool Adam
We discovered we are really mostly just water
We pretend about a past to justify right now
We tell countless lies to make it through each day
Keep on runnin' you little bunny, keep on runnin'
Duracell sold during the Super Bowl
My disease contagious, as a yawn

To prove you that life is OK
Say it after me

And the naked lady shoots me with the fish

I bought you a corsage
And pinned a flower on my jacket
Because this night means a lot to me
Then you went
And spilled punch
All on my tuxedo shirt

Oh man, it's taking me over
Oh man, it's taking me over

I found another four leaf clover
Up there on the mountain peak
Where it was hard to speak about...
And the only thing that would come out

Fun Lyrics
""Fun""
It began with a bird and eggs on a t-shirt
Came the rain and we hid coyly underneath a bridge
Sunnyside up and gone. I never thought that I would call
This home and so we celebrate
Let me show you what I ate today
I'm normally not like this. ""Sure"" she said
Johnny Law was not impressed
We played along, we could care less and things were solid after that
After that, falling stars, they dropped like flies
I saw them. We could turn a bad idea into a good one
I have fun and you can't have none",https://genius.com/Algernon-cadwallader-fun-lyrics,"""Fun""

An Idea Is A Greater Monument Than A Cathedral Lyrics
Will the same mistakes haunt you like they used to do?
Or are you afraid that your body won't let you choose?
You are your father's son
And the same disease that holds you held him once
And I know if you push this hard it will still take hold
You cannot accept the things you can't control
And I know your mind is young but your body's old
And you can't forgive yourself, though no one else could blame you for this
But hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
And already I can't remember if the heart was ever aware
That the body it kept alive was wearing out, was shutting down
And tonight, when it realized, you gave up, it cried out
""Only now I realize
I always knew (I always knew), I always knew""
""Only now I realize
I always knew (I always knew), I always knew""",https://genius.com/Empire-empire-i-was-a-lonely-estate-an-idea-is-a-greater-monument-than-a-cathedral-lyrics,"You are your father's son

I Am A Snail, And You Are A Pace I Cannot Match Lyrics
The long days piled into weeks before you'd speak
As the storm crawled to meet the shoreline
And it began to rain at once!
I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried
To keep the awful things at bay from you
But it was on the air and useless, I
Might as well have tried to prove the words
I fought to purchase would comfort you
Like, ""there was nothing more that we could do""
Or that I still loved you
When nothing could be further from the truth
Will your hand fall out of mine?
Your shame lives on its own, trying to reach
The depths down where it belongs
Will it find rest in your bones?
Aching and pulling muscles to act out against you, so
Stay your pity now
If it reaches the heart, we all pull out
And let the beat slow down
There's nothing that we can do you for now
Are you sorry, or are you just scared?
There will be no false comfort here
Oh, I ought to tell you the truth!
I did not come to plea for you
Where was your heart when your words led the truth
Anywhere else from you?
You're not sorry, you are just scared
I have not come to calm your fears

I am sorry I hid what you are
But everyone else but me

It Happened Because You Left Lyrics
In fall, the year you grew to be six feet
I tempered my fear into haste
A worry that dogged our mother
She, the baby of three, asked how
So many things could take flight at once
There are no easy answers, and even at thirteen
I could not think of a sure reply
At the church where I was baptized
Our father refused to park near the crowd
At that time, I still believed in god, or faeries
Or that the air could catch on fire
When you and your friends took off on separate routes
I wanted to follow you
But our mother said I was not allowed to
You had not yet learned how to fill such a broad frame
That winter you said you hated your body
But when spring came, you'd learned how to speak
And you moved out west
To watch the ocean eat the coast away
I can still remember that day you left
Thoughts spilling out from my chest
Like, ""who will you be when you come back?""

Everything Is Connected And Everything Matters (A Temporary Solution To A Permanent Problem) Lyrics
On a late spring day, when summer began to take shape
You lowered your head to bear an uneven compromise
How your voice held steel, make sharp by the sound of it aloud!
You were drunk on each syllable; you could not even hear what it sang
When you were young
You spent your summers in Maine
And stripped of the friends you made
You gorged yourself on Frost and Hemingway
When you came back to Michigan
You would walk with words you did not speak
And dress yourself
With an air we couldn't reach
So when you go back to Maine, I hope that you stay
Where you have cornered truth and beauty
And each borrowed refrain you sing, you sing, you sing
Will sound the same to the lonely, lonely sea",https://genius.com/Empire-empire-i-was-a-lonely-estate-everything-is-connected-and-everything-matters-a-temporary-solution-to-a-permanent-problem-lyrics,"When you were young

Rally The Troops! Poke Holes In Their Defenses! Line Our Coffers With Their Coffins! Lyrics
It flew out your mouth, ""You can drive me anywhere—
Just drive me anywhere but here tonight""
The length of your neck is a lonely parapet;
You are armed to the teeth and looking for a fight
It was in your mother's dress that the temper finally
Showed signs of slowing down
Your fingers traced the route of the seam
Like a map of your body that landed just shy of your knees
It fell the same way on your mother—
As she was, at that age, the same height as you
She never faced a fear quite as sharp
But her sister did and it broke her heart
What came out your mouth next was a series of mistakes—
You had taken all you could take, and here tonight
The weight of their stares, well, they could bury you alive
You are worn to the bone, and looking to disappear
And who could blame you?
Who could blame you?
And who could blame you?
Who could blame you?
It was in your mother's dress that the temper finally
Died out, and gave way to the fear
That keeps its company with such a loud mouth!
Like the sound of an earthquake tearing out terra firma's mouth

You must not let it in, and keep your head up
On top of your body
There are far, far worse things than this
So we must move with purpose and do what has to be done",https://genius.com/Empire-empire-i-was-a-lonely-estate-rally-the-troops-poke-holes-in-their-defenses-line-our-coffers-with-their-coffins-lyrics,"Just drive me anywhere but here tonight""

But we buried our hopes in our throats
And though it spared us from honesty
It could not deny anything else
After the air cleared
And the anger left our bodies
We slept more soundly

On Denton
Where you realized the full weight of what you had done
You felt ashamed for the first time
But still refused to admit that you were wrong!
I swore I would not carry your weight for you anymore
When, at twenty-one, you cannot help yourself
But in the time you were making up your mind
We still held our breath (We still held our breath)
So history repeats, and the feeling that I will one day wake
An old and empty man only drives me harder
Even if you will not sacrifice your youth
It will grow to resent you like a body of water
It will yield only to entrenched earth

The Next Step To Regaining Control Lyrics
I knew that you wouldn't change, but I bit my tongue and swore
Resigned myself to carry on despite you
But you would not match my stride and cried, “Foul! Foul!
How could you expect me to care about somebody else?”
And after all, who would expect anything else from you?
You would not apologize for what you claimed you'd never do
You guard your hand like there is something brilliant, waiting to play itself off
And when you move to strike, everything will fall into place
But I’ll call your bluff, I know you’re all talk
And when the words come out, there will be nothing left but promises
I wanted it to be different, to see truth where it did not fit
But the harder I looked, the farther you seemed from it
There is a cadence here, I guess, for every measured misstep
I put one foot forward and you take two steps back
You guard your hand like there is something brilliant, waiting to play itself off
And when you move to strike, everything will fall into place
But I’ll call your bluff, I know you’re all talk
And when the words come out, there will be nothing left but promises

I Was Somewhere Cold, Dark... and Lonely Lyrics
I almost died at twenty-one
In January, driving northbound on Abbott Road
The car in front of us slammed their brakes down hard
And slid off onto the right-hand shoulder
We were probably following too close
But I honestly can't remember
We swerved into the turn lane
And lost control when we hit a patch of black ice
That would carry us right into the unavoidable path of
A Saturn barreling south in the opposite direction
My life did not flash before my eyes
I was trying to steer the van anywhere else
As time ground to a halt and froze
Then exploded violently
As metal collapsed into metal
At a horrific speed
There is always 'nough time to do the things you love
Until it's gone",https://genius.com/Empire-empire-i-was-a-lonely-estate-i-was-somewhere-cold-dark-and-lonely-lyrics,"I almost died at twenty-one

Until it's gone","I almost died at twenty-one In January, driving northbound on Abbott Road And slid off onto the right-hand shoulder We were probably following too close But I honestly can't remember We swerved into the turn lane A Saturn barreling south in the opposite direction My life did not flash before my eyes I was trying to steer the van anywhere else As time ground to a halt and froze Then exploded violently As metal collapsed into metal At a horrific speed Until it's gone"

I Would Have Stolen You a Whole Orchestra Lyrics
You carry all your weight-
Tightly stretched across your face
Like evidence or proof that everything aged you
I measured steady breaths
(afraid of truth, or of being rebuked)
""what horrible things cling to you?""
I did not expect to get an answer at all
Or for your to let your guard down
But either a ghost or a sigh escaped you
Your color fled, though your resistance would not be moved
You said, ""when you have given so much, so little remains
Like a wound that will never heal, all that's left is to wait""",https://genius.com/Empire-empire-i-was-a-lonely-estate-i-would-have-stolen-you-a-whole-orchestra-lyrics,"You carry all your weight-

Verse 1
]
I could hear you coming, so I hid by the couch
You were talking so loudly, I don't know what about
But you were drunker than high school, self-conscious and sweet
I never ever felt so cool disguised in your sheets

But I'm a constant headache, a tooth out of line
They try to make you regret it
You tell 'em, ""No, not this time.""
I'm just a constant headache, a dead pet device
You hang me up unfinished
With the better part of me no longer mine

And then you finally found me, pretending to sleep
You said such nice things about me, I felt guilty and cheap
You took two steps to the kitchen and just stared at the sink
I couldn't hold back a smile, 
I still wish I could have seen
You having sex in the morning,
 
your love was foreign to me
It made me think maybe human's not such a bad thing to be
But I just laid there in protest, 
entirely fucked
It's such a stubborn reminder one perfect night's not enough

It's just a constant headache, a tooth out of line
They try to make you regret it

Falling in Love Again Lyrics

Thanks for showing me around last night
Hope you don't think I don't care
Because I do, I just don't know if I
Should feel this bad about you
After finishing your birthday drugs
Look at a yearbook unprepared
And betray yourself to sleep it off
Then come down to collect it

I think you're funny
I like your friends
I like the way they treat you
I've got some money
That we could spend
Not that you're like that
I'm falling in love again

Catalina Fight Song Lyrics
Joyce Manor was formed in Torrance, California, which is reasonably close to Catalina Island and Sunken City.

Sunken city by the ocean
You could teach the seventh grade
Do you think because you chose to?

You always
Fell in love the way you're supposed to
At the Target inside of the mall
Fear of what you weren't exposed to
There's no way
To keep in touch with certain people
You wonder how long something can last
Pretty sure most people don't think about that
But who the fuck's laughing now?

Sunken city by the ocean
Car smells like hot Gatorade
Do you think because you chose to?
Do you think things are different than you think they are?
Never really had a drug phase
So you think you're fucking miserable now?

A super-hot friend with a fake ID
She takes off her clothes and hands them to me

Herself out of her room

Last You Heard of Me Lyrics

Found myself down at the Alibi
For the second time this year
Wrote my song down, gave it to the guy
Then went to grab another beer

Sonia's going to the parking lot
Probably gonna smoke some weed
I'd go with, but I don't touch the stuff
Unless I wanna go to sleep

You step outside to have a cigarette
As smokers crowd into the street
Digging through your purse for matches
When, for a second, our eyes meet

And in the moment, I see everything
Start to finish, sad defeat
Shivering, lying naked next to you

I lost it all in a beach community

I torch up your house while your kids are at home

When you make it to your driveway
Will you call to let me know that you're okay?
And when you make it to your bedroom
Do you collapse on your bed right away?
Or do you lay and think about how fucking lonely you've become?
You're obsessed with revenge and it's starting again
Bad tattoos, oh, and losing the saddest of friends, so you

Ache through the days
'Cause you'll never mend your ways

And when you make a decent living
Will you buy me a train set and a hat?
So that I can sit alone in my room
Sending people away from the ones they love
Or crash them into buildings
Explosions, derailments and screaming children

But doesn't it feel good
To take off your t-shirt
And let somebody feel you
Somebody steal you
You can't get behind what
You can't even find it

It’s nothing to fear, easy for you to say

Say, doesn't it feel bad
Things that you can't have
Even when you were near her
Wearing a T-shirt
You can't be defined by
What you're keeping inside
Might push you into the limelight
Just give it a try, still don't believe in yourself

Life's a bad dream
Then you wake up

In your new leather jacket, you're somebody else
And it's not nice to meet you in a fortress of self

'Cause my mother's fast asleep
Right next door

Yeah, I'm 26, and I still live with my parents
Oh, I can't do laundry
Christ, I can't do dishes
What'll I do without you?
When your body fails you
When nobody loves you
All they do is miss you
But they don't even care

So be careful when you run downstairs
Be careful who you talk to
Or the wonderful way you walk
You are like a magnet for all evil


So you just stand there
With a dollar at your feet
And you wait as I retreat
To go get mine
And when I get back
You're too terrified to speak
And my brother's such a creep
Even more

Yeah, be careful when you run downstairs
Be careful who you talk to
Or the wonderful way you walk
You are like a magnet for all evil
'Cause there's so much good inside you
And I wish that I could hide you
Someplace no one could hurt you
Where nobody could change you

I'll lock you in my room
And I'll tie you to the sheets
'Cause I could watch you sleep for weeks
Oh, the things you'd never see
If it were up to me


Oh, I can't do laundry
Christ, I can't do dishes
What'll I do without you?

End of the Summer Lyrics
Case closed, that's fine
Everybody's going to
Your house, inside
Never thought about that
Like I'm supposed to
In the blacklight
At the end of the summer
It's too sad
Blue marker on a paper bag
You could wear it like a mask
You could be your own dad
Like you're supposed to
I could show you
At the end of the summer
I start to feel it fade away
There's nothing I can do
At the end of the summer
Try to imagine there's a way
For me and you

Lie to me, like you used to
Tell me everything is how it should be
Lie to me, did you have to?
'Cause in the end, it never matters what I think

And I can barely tell the sky from the shoreline
And I can see myself reflected in your eyes

And this was all a dream

I Saw Water Lyrics

I saw water

I said I wanted to break my friends
But my dependency won't let me away
I'd like to think that I can work it out some
But I want to be put into the ground
Today, I needed a break
My friends are up in mountains and I'm drowning in lakes
I swallowed water right in front of her face
Just to show that she had nothing to say

I felt lighter
I impressed her

But my emotions ran unopposed
I felt just like Brian Jones
I've never felt that lost before
I just don't feel incredible

But me, well of course I liked you
Have time for me, I don't expect you to
I see me become a recluse
It's very easy to seclude


I saw water
I felt better

Well I woke up feeling embarrassed from
When I drowned in my swimming pool
You thought it was an accident
But I just can't get along with you

Waiting for the sun but I know that it'll come
I feel reborn when you touch my arm
Whole new view, feels better when I talk to you
I get scared with what I wear
Even when you yell, I still love your belly
It's true, it's true
Riding it through the night
Straight through

It still feels new when I talk to you
I feel reborn when the sun gets warm
It's hard but I feel better when I'm not inside
I get scared you'll leave me soon
Even though we call each other every afternoon
It's true, it's true
It took a little time but I, but I know you

Now it's hard for me to show you anything I write
I know that I get nervous when we're not alone

When we started talking, I got so excited
And I swear I tried to go out every single night
I know that you will always be the one who's my...

June Lyrics

Cruel one convinced you in his stillness
In a dream, safe and harmless

Unknown to you
Wolf in sheep’s clothing
Hand over mouth
His secrets you’re holding
I can see you and the ache you’re hiding
I’m here you know I’ll always remind you

Lonely one, I always knew
The future tells a hazel view
Gemstone, like polish and acetone
For you are my sister sewn
I know you like the drive home
Breath deep, the knower’s perspective
You’ll see how the rest of this is undeniable

Hold out for June, it brings new season
Vision is clear, your mind revealing
Pressing the flower in the page
Forever kept, a memory made
Now you’re so sure, you’re always leading
All the same words now bring new meaning
I can hear you and I know you’re singing
“I’m here you know I’ll always remind you.”


Lovely one
Four leaf luck
Skilled hands built you up

Hold out for June, it brings new season
Vision is clear, your mind revealing

I'm serious, there's confidence

Hoping showing confidence is gonna make you stay
Well every time you talk, I love everything you say

I'll pass it off

Well, it costs dollars to write this song
For gas money, and a ride home
Well, I've thought it through and I'm better now
For such a long time, step down

Knowing that you're so close only hangs me up, again
Suffice to say, the price I pay won't matter in the end
This is something I can't even talk about with friends
I'll pass it off

I've never been awake before the sun comes up
Well, I could never worry about you enough
Everything I say is obvious

Coming down slowly, coming down slowly
Watching the water rise and fall again
I want to know what you think about
I feel alone when we’re apart
So shut me up, don’t shut me out

Let me down slowly, let me down slowly
Fragile mind will break into a thousand parts
After all this time still running from the same things
It feels like all my life I’m running from the same things

I put it all on the line, would you be my escape plan?
I put it all on the line, would you be my escape plan?

Coming down slowly, coming down slowly
Prettiest words couldn’t fix what was torn apart
I know something’s wrong, I’ve got a feeling that I can’t shake
Wasting all my time just wishing that you could stay

Under the surface, you confront yourself
You wonder what life would be like if I was someone else
But I am patient, I refuse to concede or believe
That I am only what you want me to be
Only what you want me to be

Follows Lyrics
Cut away from the shell of a life
I had found myself wandering into
Behind glass I was frozen like time
In a memory you can't get away from
Killing time, we're all just killing time
Going out every night to feel fine
This chemical courage and positive lines
Against all of the things that we're trying to hide
I should have listened to you when you said
""Nothing will make this easier""
I should have listened to you when you said
""Running won't get you away from this""
It follows wherever I go
It follows wherever I go
Worried mind like a camera lens
With no clarity left for the picture
Filter out what I want to forget
Wipe away all the names and the faces
I should have listened to you when you said
""Nothing will make this easier""
I should have listened to you when you said
""Running won't get you away from this""

Down a spiral stairway
Like a blackout memory
You prop up your work
Like a figure of straw
Keeping your ghosts from the garden
But is it red ripe or deadened skin?
Spiraling further in
Spiraling further in

Burn a candle to my skin
Turn the handle, let me in
I cannot be your guardian anymore
Burn a candle to my skin
Turn the handle, let me in
I cannot be your medicine anymore, anymore

I am a moment in time
When your eyes start to wander
And your head starts to spin
From the simplest task
Deciding what you will wear
Finding faults in a straight line
I have to remember to stop
Wringing out the same cloth

I haven't got much left to take
When I'm overseas I can't see your face
And I know it's distance that you hate
So I've got a flight and I'm on my way
I can't stand the time that we spend apart
Lose track of time when we're in the dark
In the front seat of your Cadillac
I spent so much time that I can't get back (Get back)

We got where we were going to but we were late

Charmer Lyrics
I was getting bored of the compliments
You were sleeping over the best part of it
Telling me something I don't care about
See my silhouette on your shoulder blade
I'm the only person that does what I want
Telling me something I don't care about
Definitely feeling unnecessary pain
Say that there's no consequence
Then you walk away
Hey I need you, my new charmer
I've been thinking, don't you wanna
Be my perfect bae instead?
I can’t sleep in other beds
Can I have ya, my Madonna?

Twin Size Mattress Lyrics
Twin Size Mattress tells the story of a close friendship damaged and eventually destroyed by addiction. It is among the most beloved Front Bottoms songs.

This is for the lions living in the wiry, broke-down frames of my friends' bodies
When the floodwater comes, it ain't gonna be clear; it's gonna look like mud
But I will help you swim
I will help you swim, I'm gonna help you swim

This is for the snakes and the people they bite
For the friends I've made, for the sleepless nights
For the warning signs I've completely ignored
There's an amount to take, reasons to take more
It's no big surprise you turned out this way
When they closed their eyes and prayed you would change
And they cut your hair and sent you away
You stopped by my house the night you escaped
With tears in my eyes, I begged you to stay
You said, ""Hey, man, I love you, but no fucking way""

I'm sure that we could find something for you to do on stage
Maybe shake a tambourine, or when I sing, you sing harmonies

This is for the lake that me and my friends swim in
Naked and dumb on a drunken night
But it should've felt good, but I could hear the 
Jaws
 theme song
On repeat in the back of my mind
Make sure you kiss your knuckles before you punch me in the face
There are lessons to be learned and consequences for all the stupid things I say
And it is no big surprise you turned out this way
The spark in your eyes, the look on your face
I will not be blamed


I'm sure that we could find something for you to do on stage
Maybe shake a tambourine, or when I sing, you sing harmonies

I wanna contribute to the chaos
I don't wanna watch and then complain
'Cause I am through finding blame
That is a decision that I have made


She hopes I'm cursed forever
To sleep on a twin-size mattress
In somebody's attic or basement my whole life
Never graduating up in size to add another
And my nightmares will have nightmares every night
Oh, every night, every night",https://genius.com/The-front-bottoms-twin-size-mattress-lyrics,"But I will help you swim

Father Lyrics
“Father” is a story concerning three characters: the narrator, apparently a high-school aged boy; his girlfriend, to whom the song is addressed; and an abusive father.

I have this dream that I am hitting my dad with a baseball bat
And he is screaming and crying for help
And maybe halfway through, it has more to do with me killing him
Than it ever did protecting myself
And I believe that yeah, Dad, maybe no one is perfect
But I believe that you are pushing your luck
It just sucks it played out like this, a terrible movie
You can tell none of the actors even give a fuck

But you look good tonight, girlfriend
Can I sleep in your bed?
And when I crawl out in the morning
Can I stay inside your head?

'Cause you were high school
And I was just more like real life
And you were okay, okay as a girlfriend
But I was just more like his wife
I'll do the push-ups, I'll wear the makeup
I'll do whatever he wants all night
'Cause you were okay, okay as a girlfriend
But I was just more like real life


A long, long time ago, my great-great-great-great-grandfather
Took something that did not belong to him
And that is why today, I have an eagle in my veins
I am part Native American
And I am leaving as soon as I come
As soon as I come, you will probably forget my name
I hope I fall asleep at the wheel and crash my car
(On the way home) Or I could just stay here, because

You look good tonight, girlfriend
Can I sleep in your bed?
And when I crawl out in the morning
Can I stay inside your head?

'Cause you were high school
And I was just more like real life
And you were okay, okay as a girlfriend, girlfriend
But I was just more like his wife
I'll wear the makeup, I'll do the push-ups
I'll do whatever he wants all night

I got boulders on my shoulders
Collarbones begin to crack
There is very little left of me
And it's never coming back
There are certain things you ask of me
And there are certain things I lack
In the beginning, we were winning
But now I'm just making up facts

What's it matter anymore?
If you believe the lies I tell
(What's it matter anymore?)
There's no meaning to the words
But we still sing these songs well
(What's it matter anymore?)
If we all left it alone
I'm sure it'd work itself out fine
(What's it matter, what's it matter, what's it matter anymore?)
We keep playing with the numbers
We are running out of time
We are running, we are running

But you're a killer
And I'm your best friend
Think it's unfair, your situation
You say I'm changing
Sorry, I didn't know I had to stay the same
Could we talk about this later?
Your voice is driving me, driving me insane


Well, I try to write you poems, but the words, they don't make sense
My hand tries to grip the pencil, but the fingers are too tense
And I try to show emotion, but my eyes won't seem to wet
And I'd love to tell you stories, but I can't remember how they went
You're a flashlight in a dark room for the loneliest blackout
You were all we had left after it all was filtered out
Turn you on in a dark room right before we both pass out
Turn you on when I need you, but the batteries ran out
They ran out

And 
you're a werewolf and I'm a full moon
And all your very worst enemies will be gone soon
I think you're changing
Don't worry, you don't gotta stay the same
Could we talk about this later?

Which puts them in mad shady situations with mad shady people

And they are probably just drinking and talking about
How she misses getting fucked up and hangin' around

Lone Star Lyrics
Sella has made it very clear in this interview that the song is not about himself but about a friend’s experience.

The name Lone Star stems from a brand of beer the band drank while recording in Austin, Texas.

Goodbye future, once so bright
Meet my pregnant girlfriend
Watch my bank account run dry
Four hundred thirty-seven dollars spent
To put things back to the way they used to be
Still, I woulda spent so much more
But four hundred thirty-seven dollars somehow shakes all responsibility
But it's not easy

She looks me dead in the eyes and says, ""Hey, Brian
If you still believe in the Lord above
Get on your hands and knees and pray for us
Get on your hands and knees and pray for us""

The past few months were pretty rough
A couple times, wished we both were dead
I never cried like that before
I thought my eyes would pop out of my head
Not just preparing for nightmares
Years and years I do suppose
Nothing feels alright now
The length of my hair or the fit of my clothes
And crying like a baby solved nothing


'Cause I can leave, so what, now what, so where do I go?
'Cause I could imagine myself throwing all my clothes inside a suitcase
Without bothering to fold them
'Cause I could imagine myself throwing all my things inside a suitcase
Without bothering to fold them

She looked me dead in the eyes and said, ""Hey, Brian
If you still believe in the Lord above
Get on your hands and knees and pray for us
Get on your hands and knees and pray for us""

You are my peach, you are my plum
You are my Earth, you are my Sun
All of your fingers, all of your toes
The back of your head, the tip of your nose

And you are the reason I'm smiling
When there is nothing to smile about
Yeah, you are the reason I'm smiling
When there is nothing to smile about

One day, you will find someone who will love you like you deserve
But tonight, I'm the only one left, and I'm betting it's a fact that you will never learn
Once I sink my teeth, your skin's not so tough
I'll leave a tiny cut
There'll be a lot of blood
But once you wipe it up
You will feel better about our entire situation

You are my light, no need to hide
You are my clock, keep me on time
You are my angel,
 
you are my crime
I'll serve this sentence the rest of my life


And you are the reason I'm smiling
When there is nothing to smile about
Yeah, you are the reason I'm smiling
When there is nothing to smile about

I do things wrong
You thought I might
You say I'm gonna miss you when you leave
And you are probably right
But I'm just as stoned
I don't wanna fight
You say I should think before I talk
You say I shouldn't think about my life
'Cause once I finally hit the ground
Who's gonna drag me into the light?

The Plan (Fuck Jobs) Lyrics

I fucking hate the comments
Why do you feel you have to talk?
Nobody asked for your opinion
Your sick, sad way of jerking off
Everyone you think you're better than
What the fuck! I'm guilty too
Half the time that I'm complaining
I'm just talking shit on you, I'm sorry

Never underestimate
The poor, hungry, and desperate
My body is a temple
How much do you think I can get for it?
And I will take cold showers
From now on until I learn
That once you fuck the fire
All that's left to do is burn, baby, burn; baby, burn

I could feel myself falling from an aeroplane
I hear static when I close my eyes
I imagine one day, things settling
And I think about what that might be like


'Cause I love you, I miss you
(When my mind is uncertain, my body decides)
I wanna hug and kiss you
(What it will do to get through the hell of life)
Oh, I love you, I miss you
(As I trip on the ocean that leads through your eyes)
I wanna hug and kiss you, it´s alright

I want world domination
Just like everybody else
So if you hear me talking strategy
Aw, it's only to myself
Everybody's got to have a game plan
Cut it up a couple different ways
Just hope no one remembers these
The darkest of my days

When my mind is uncertain, my body decides
When my mind is uncertain, my body decides
When my mind is uncertain, my body decides
When my mind is uncertain, my body decides
When my mind is uncertain, my body decides
When my mind is uncertain, my body decides

There's comfort in the bottom of a swimming pool
I'm holding my breath for you
There's no doubt in my mind
That if you could, then you would try
To crack my ribcage open
And pull my heart right through

There's comfort in the bottom of a swimming pool
I'm holding my breath for you
There's no doubt in my mind
That if you could, then you would try
To crack my ribcage open
And pull my heart right through

But I'm a creature
Of a culture that I create
I'm the last one on the dance floor
As the chandelier gives way
And I am permanently preoccupied with your past
I've been around long enough now
To know that the good things never last
They never last


There's comfort in the silence of a living room
The TV is on for you
Hide in your basement
While your house burns down
Your teeth are loose inside of your gums
They will eventually fall out
Follow an orange extension cord
Under a carpet, to a closet door
Feeding the black light
That will someday make me very, very, very
Very, very rich

But I'm a creature
Of a culture that I create
And I'm the last one on the dance floor
As the chandelier gives way
And I am permanently preoccupied with your past
I've been around long enough now
To know that the good things never last
They never last

How low is your self esteem?
How low could it possibly be?
And I know, I know, you're in love with me
And I've been ignoring you


To listen press ""one"", to record a message press ""two""
What the fuck is wrong with you, you fuckin' moron?
You fuckin' moron, what the fuck is wrong with you?
You pick up the girl, you're done, it's over with, you fuckin' idiot!

I will stop cutting my pants into shorts
I will address the issues I cannot ignore
And I will do the things I think you might like
And I will be alone, probably the rest of my life

You're very close to bein' the dumbest motherfucker I've ever met in my life
I'm starting to think you'd be the dumbest motherfucker to ever walk this earth
I'm givin' you advice
Turn around right now
Who the fuck

It's wrong, what you're doing is wrong
That you ""needed the closure"", well, how is this better?
What the fuck did you drive to her house for?
""Closure""? What ""closure""?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Breaking up with you. Done. Bye

""Is it raining where you are?""
The only thing I could think to ask
But nothing ever hurt so bad
As the ""no"" that you said back

But ain't that the truth, man?
Those are just facts
The farther you go from where you start
The harder it is to get back

Love of my life
Gone forever
Love of my life
Gone for good
(This is for all my friends in West Virginia)

The good stuff comes, the good stuff goes
The good stuff seems so hard to hold
Hope it slides slowly down your throat
So the taste of it may linger

Right now I'm just a volcano (like I said)
On the brink of eruption (like I said!)
Right now I'm just a psycho
Hell-bent on self-destruction

There ain't no lord up above

Or a life-saving love

I thought I had it all figured out
I had to organize my words good
Before they'd fall right out my mouth
And I had learned that the direction
I was walking was so wrong
I just need a little help here, man
To find the path I should be on

Wolfman Lyrics
This song, along with Handcuffs, was released on Liberty and Prosperity, a split with GDP for Record Store Day 2015!

Deep and slow, that's how it goes
If anyone asks, yeah, I already know
'Cause I got this pain in my chest
Every time I swim to consciousness
And I misspelled every word perfectly
Every mistake made was purposely
And my head is pounding to the beat of my heart

You are a broken heart tattoo
I'll have forever on my chest
For a love that I have lost
But never could forget

Say what you have to say

Funny You Should Ask Lyrics

The good thing about this cast is I can still hold a knife
So if you ever twist my arm again, I'll be sure to put up a fight
You see, I just don't wanna do the things that you want me to do
But I'm a sucker, so I do them, 'cause I am still in love with you

She said, ""Honey, you gotta learn that love is simple, just like mud
If you play the dirt, then I'll play the water—all we gotta do is touch""

'Cause I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anything
But I'm older now and know that I should
'Cause I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anything
But I'm older now and know that I should

It is freezing
And I am watching you shovel snow
Off a driveway
Across from my parent's home
Now it's summer
 (Now it's summer)
And you are laying out on your lawn
You look so sexy, Chelsea
With your polka-dot bikini on


Come on, Chelsea, 
speak a little French to me
Heard you spent two whole semesters drinking wine
While I was stuck in Jersey, trying to save some money
I guess I'm just another thing you left behind

But you were young, you thought you didn't have to care about anyone
But you're older now and wish that you could
'Cause you were young, you thought you didn't have to care about anyone
But you're older now and know that you should

It's funny you should ask
'Cause I don't remember
It's funny you should ask
I could've been a contender

One, two three! (Three) Everyone, say, ""Cheese!"" (Cheese)
Thought you got the best of me—turns out it was a video
Me and my best friend, me and my cousins
Sitting there smiling—turns out it was a video

But I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anyone
But I'm older now and know that I should
'Cause I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anyone
But I'm older now and know that I should


It's funny you should ask
'Cause I don't remember
It's funny you should ask
I coulda been a contender
It's funny you should ask
(Thought I didn't have to care about anything)
No, I will not surrender

Cough It Out Lyrics
“Cough It Out” is an ode to the sensation that often accompanies smoking weed. Perhaps not coincidentally, it is exactly 4 minutes and 20 seconds long.

It’s snowing right now; I wish it was summer
But when the summer rolls around, I wish I was freezing
They don’t call me ""Mr. Greenside"" for no reason
When they do, I pause and cough it out
I cough it out, I cough it out, I cough it out
I cough it out

All the branches on the tree
That we carved our initials in
Seem to bend and take the shape of them
And, oh, can’t you see?
I am delusional with love
I am delusional with love
I am delusional with love

I don’t care if you’re not sorry; I forgive you
And with or without your support, I will continue
What I’m trying to say is you never know what you’ve been through
'Til you pause and cough it out
I cough it out, I cough it out, I cough it out
I cough it out

All the branches on the tree
That we carved our initials in
Seem to bend and take the shape of them
And, oh, can’t you see?
I am delusional with love
I am delusional with love
I am delusional with love
I am delusional with love
I am delusional with love
I am delusional with love


But whatever I did for you last year, I cannot do again
It’s getting harder and harder and harder and harder for me to call you ""friend""
No matter how many times I say I won’t, I defend you if I can
But whatever I did for you last year, I cannot do again

I like the in-betweens
I like the time it takes to get somewhere
If you know what I mean
Wave your hands in the air like you just don’t care
I just don’t care
I just don’t care, I just don’t care, I just don’t care
I just don’t care

All the branches on the tree
That we carved our initials in
Seem to bend and take the shape of them
And, oh, can’t you see?
I am delusional with love
I am delusional with love
I am delusional with love

But whatever I did for you last year
I cannot do it again
I will not do it again",https://genius.com/The-front-bottoms-cough-it-out-lyrics,"I cough it out, I cough it out, I cough it out

Vacation Town Lyrics

I want to be that 
comfortable
 place where you write and read
Watch TV, or deeply breathe
Back to back, you and me feel trapped
Never defend, only attack
You be Rachel and I'll be bong rips
We'll get high all day

I miss the hours in the morning
And you in the morning hours
I miss walking, naked
Through the backyard to get to the outdoor shower
I miss the way things used to be
I miss the way things used to be
It's okay, no one's around
I'm off-season vacation town
Vacation town

I wanna see everything, lay it all out for me
Feel the breeze
With all the windows open in a one-star hotel room
But I could only express my love
When I'm fucked up or far, far away
Physically, another continent
Emotionally, another headspace
Mentally, I'm not even here


I miss the hours in the morning
And you in the morning hours
I miss walking, naked
Through the backyard to get to the outdoor shower
I miss the way things used to be
I miss the way things used to be
It's okay, no one's around
I'm off-season vacation town
(Vacation town)

Lonely Eyes Lyrics
A song off of “I Hate My Friends” by The Front Bottoms, which is their debut demo record. This song details the speakers love with a depressed girl.

You got me stuck to where I'm sittin', lookin' at your eyes
And I know I'm so pathetic, I wouldn't move to save my life
And they tell me that you're lonely, it's no surprise
When you walk around all day wearing those lonely, lonely
Lonely  eyes

Well, I try to tell you jokes
, I'm afraid you'd cry
And if you need a little sunshine, you could borrow some of mine
""It's okay if you're unhappy,"" I would say before I leave her
""Just take a look around, there's no one here that's happy either""

Lonely girl, you are my world
And I could be anything you need
And if for some reason, you don't feel like talkin'
I could just sit and enjoy your company
Your company

Well, the days keep going by, and it doesn't get much better
You could be threatening to jump, and all your friends would just scream, ""Let her!""
They count on you to leave 'cause it's always been that way
But on the one day they close early, that's the one you want to stay


Lonely girl, you are my world
And I could be anything you need
And if for some reason, you don't feel like talking
I could just sit and enjoy your company
Your company


Lonely girl, you are my world
And I could be anything you need
And if for some reason, you don't feel like talkin'
I could just sit and enjoy your company
Lonely girl, you are my world
And I could be anything you need
And if for some reason, you don't feel like talking

'Cause you are water twelve feet deep
And I am boots made of concrete
I'll wear cool clothes, you could show some skin
Flash a fake, so we will both get in
Now we're dancing, we're so drunk
We are so cool, we are so punk

And yes, we can keep living like this
As long as you're here I will live like this

Since when did...
Since when did ""I wanna hear your voice""
Not become a good excuse?
Calling you three in the morning
Laugh at sleep that we'll both lose
Maybe college won't work out
And I can come stay at your house

But my roommate just passed out

I started using again
Left my heart in 
Rocky Hill
, hole burning in my head
Needed a distraction from my head
Devil on my shoulder said try this instead
So I started using again

I started sleeping again
Traded late nights and sheep for Vicodin
The guilt burning in my chest set in
I started sleeping again

I stopped wishing I was dead
Learned to love myself before anyone else
Become more than just a burden
I know I'm more than worthy of your time


I started smoking again
Guess I missed coughing my lungs up every morning
Needed anything to keep me breathing
To prevent my blood from bleeding
I started smoking again


I started loving again
Thought when I lost that will to live I could never feel again
I'll give it one more shot and let someone in

This last week
I slept eight hours total, I barely sleep
Maybe that's why I've been weak
The same things that plague you still plaguing me
When God called you to fulfill a vacancy
I tried to see why it wasn't me

So I didn't show up to your funeral
But I showed up to your house
And I didn't move a muscle
I was quiet as a mouse
And I swore I saw you in there
But I was looking at myself

I'm placing bets against myself
And honestly I'm a mess
Like a car engulfed in flames
I am a wreck
Things I should have said through call or text
I've just really been so busy and I regret

'Cause if there's no rest for the wicked
I'm as evil as it gets
 (Things I should have said)


So I didn't show up to your funeral
But I showed up to your house
And I didn't move a muscle
I was quiet as a mouse
And I swore I saw you in there
But I was looking at myself

So will you show up to my funeral?
Will you be wearing white or black?
And I know the force is in you
It's the energy I lack

This last week
I slept eight hours total, I barely sleep
Maybe that's why I've been weak
When God called you to fulfill a vacancy
I tried to see why it wasn't me
So I didn't show up to your funeral
But I showed up to your house
And I didn't move a muscle
I was quiet as a mouse
And I swore I saw you in there
But I was looking at myself
I'm placing bets against myself
And honestly I'm a mess
Like a car engulfed in flames
I am a wreck
I've just really been so busy and I regret
'Cause if there's no rest for the wicked
I'm as evil as it gets
(Things I should have said)
So I didn't show up to your funeral
But I showed up to your house
And I didn't move a muscle
I was quiet as a mouse
And I swore I saw you in there
But I was looking at myself
So will you show up to my funeral?
Will you be wearing white or black?
And I know the force is in you
It's the energy I lack

I will surely come in last

When you told me you were leaving
Well, I couldn't feel my mouth
'Cause all I'll ever be is someone else
As I watched you walk away
I felt something in me change
My heart froze over, all emotion dripped away

So I drove home at a hundred miles an hour
Just to see what it feels like to fly
And I crashed my car into someone else's backyard
Just to see what it feels like to die

When you told me that you missed me
Well, I couldn't close my eyes
'Cause I realized what it felt like to die
'Cause all you'll ever be
Is a nightmare and a wet dream
A reason to smile from six feet underground

So I drove home at a hundred miles an hour
Just to see what it feels like to die
And I crashed my car into someone else's backyard
Just to see what it feels like to die


So bathe me in pale flesh
Promise that I'll never be good again
And I hope you miss me when I'm gone
'Cause I can't hold on for too long
And I'm so scared of dying alone
That I'll kill myself right here, right now

And I'll die, and I'll die, and I'll die, and I'll die
And I'll die, and I'll die, and I'll die

A Portrait Of Lyrics

I've been feeling suicidal
And if I need remind you
It's not the coming of my heart and my brain
I was thinking 'bout how great
It would be if I could make the tightness in my chest go away
It's been a while since I've seen God
And I'm not trying to lead him on
But He's always trying to fuck me
To the tune of my favorite song
And they're playing ""The '59 Sound"" in Heaven
While the angels were drinking up whiskey and Cokes
It's hard to freeze your anxieties
When your best friends' torching your coat
Your coat

Drop that phone, drink a glass of water
And call me when you get in your bed
I've seen inside your head
And I'm doing the surgery on the parts
That still wish you were dead
'Cause I've lost too many friends
So I'll say it again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And I'm not trying to say it's easy
But I'm trying to say it's fine
I've still got some demons
And they're not gonna be leaving any time
Any time soon, any time soon
Any time soon, any time soon


I'm not trying to say it's easy
But I'm trying to say it's fine

Since I was thirteen I've dealt with manic depression
And I had a difficult time comprehending the things that I wanted to be
And I lived a very happy life and I was turning eighteen
And I was doing everything I could, try and make myself feel better
But I felt an absence, I felt
Like I needed to die, I felt
Like nothing existed
And I felt that I wasn't worthwhile breathing the same air as the ones I loved and my family
And then it came to a point where I started losing friends
The people who had the same fucking ideas as myself
But I have to be strong and I have to live my life as a continuation of theirs lost
And I have to do everything in my fucking power
To be the person that I can be
And live my life the best way I fucking can
And some days it's so hard to fucking stand
And fucking stand and fucking stand and fucking stand",https://genius.com/Sorority-noise-a-portrait-of-lyrics,"I've been feeling suicidal

Wiping my eyes of sleep
Drinking yesterday morning's coffee
Slam my head against the wall
Put the same black jeans on
Wear a hat so you can't see my hair

Maybe I won't die this time

What does it mean to be happy?
And am I getting better?
I used to make excuses for myself but it’s not the weather
I’ve tried to rid myself of my anxious tendencies
But I have to accept my head for what it is to me
I’m not super human
Well I’m barely alive
But I would kill to leave my house and not be afraid of the outside
So I started thinking
It’d be so nice
To not have trouble sleeping
I haven’t slept in nights

So I called to apologize
For every night
I told you I didn’t want to live my life
But I hung up
Before you picked up
'Cause I changed my mind

I know more about plants
Than I know about myself
And if giving up doesn’t make you stronger then why the hell am I still here?
Call me depressed
And tell me to get over it
It’s not in my head
And it’s in my blood


So I called to apologize
For every night
I told you I didn’t want to live my life
But I hung up
Before you could pick up

Let me be the drug
That you use to fall in love

Like water in a wound
Stitch me up when you are done

The last sip of gin you can't drink
Let me hide in your neck
With every regret
You're too proud to swallow before you go to bed
And why do I still compare everyone that I love
To the way I loved you?
I can still hear you sing
But you'll never sing for me

Corrigan Lyrics

All I wanna be is the one you sometimes miss
When you're with your friends
I wanna be the spit that tingles on your lips
And if you find yourself scared to be alone
All I wanna be is the house you call a home

All I'll ever be is the sound of grinding teeth
The autumn wind that blows your hair and the hand that's out of reach
If you think you can't find a way to breathe
All I'll ever be is the smoke to clear the sea

I will never be the one you need
I only hope to be the solid ground beneath your feet
I will never be the turning of your leaves
I just hope to be the one you call when you can't sleep

Disappeared Lyrics

I took some time to myself
To sort out all the things
That make me feel the way that I feel

Just this year I lost a basketball team to heaven
And I'm sure they're shooting jumpers
With Jesus, Mary, and Joseph
And you said we wouldn't notice it
If you had disappeared
But I swore I got a phone call
So that seemed pretty weird
So caught up in my own head

I took a walk down my street
Thought I'd find something to eat
But I headed back immediately
'Cause I'm pretty scared of guns
So go out and have some fun, let loose
And I'll daydream of the noose that took my friend Sean's life

And he thought we wouldn't notice it
If he had disappeared
But I swore I got a phone call
So that seemed pretty weird
So caught up in my own head


I let my hair down today
And I took a shower for the first time in what felt like weeks
I felt my hair falling out
And I felt myself falling down
But that can't seem to be the reason
I can't sleep when I'm alone
It's getting better
And it's hardly getting worse
It's hard to think about the things that make it all hurt

I found myself on the street
You swore that you would love me
And I swore I'd love you too

Car Lyrics
Eighteen minutes ago you called me on my phone
You said, ""I'm sorry, why do I feel so alone?""
I said, ""I'm sorry, is there anything that I can do?""
You said, ""Care about me like you used to""
I'm sleeping in a van most nights
It's not ideal but I've never felt more alive
In fact, I've never felt quite exactly the way that I am
My friends are dying quicker than I possibly can
Nineteen minutes ago you called me on my phone
I've been keeping tabs on when I call you on the phone
So I call you every day but I guess if every day
Means some days then I call you every day
Beware that I'm not who I used to be
I've had a lot of things go wrong with me
And I'm sorry I'm not capable but I'm not
My parents, they are moving from my house
75 Granite St.'s no longer where I live
Or send the mail to or the things that I don't want to receive
My parents love me or at least now I'm alive to see
Twenty minutes ago you called me on my phone
You said, ""Cameron, why do I feel so alone?""
I said, ""I'm sorry, is there anything that I can do?""
You said, ""Care about me like you used to""

Not too long ago you called me on my phone
And I held back tears 'cause I was feeling so alone

You had the brightest dreams
You were gonna be an artist
Who plays in a band
But I guess all things change
When you're laying on the side of the road
In the Everglades
How the hell did it make sense
After you saw what Charlie went through
Does hell taste as sweet as you thought
Do you like what you bought
I guess Dali's not overrated
And you're not the person I love
Takes a lot more than a ""How have you been?""

And you look like bad news

Nolsey Lyrics
I suppose, in this ever-growing search for love
I'll transcend all my clothes and become bare
'Cause I'm not sure of anything in this world
Except I'm always wearing black and sleeping in
How could you compose yourself each day knowing all I know
I'd cross my heart and hope to die I swear
But we remain separate in disdain
Barely breathing enemies
And I grow so dark I can barely sleep
If you ask me how I feel about myself
I'd ask you that right back and expect a pause
Who are we to be really feeling anything?
It's always been my dream to be empty
So drain me of the parts that weigh me down
Take my skin and tear me up
Make me out to be stronger than I know
Make me out to be stronger than I know
(I know) you'll never love me
I'll pretend that you love me
You'll always be the reason I stay clean",https://genius.com/Sorority-noise-nolsey-lyrics,"I suppose, in this ever-growing search for love

When your teeth turn gray and stain your tongue
When you bite so hard on your lip, blood fills your mouth
You can't swallow it 'cause you can't swallow guilt
When your best friend dies and your next friend dies
And your best friend's friend takes his life
And you spend six months on your own
'Cause there's no one left to talk to

I still hear them talk, and they say to me;
""I am not alive, I didn't mean to leave you when I died

Two beers in
Already feels like it's one of those nights to forget
The more that I drink, the more that I feel broken and alone

His big grin
He doesn't know that you'll leave him so broken and alone
When it comes to an end

Tongue Tied Lyrics

What I say is what I get
I’m just tongue-tied
Waiting in the back of my mind is “You’re not worth it”
A daily dose of my own regret
And unsaid feelings that I won’t forget
So I speak the truth into empty cans and bottles
(It’s a problem)

The definition of a diary but put into a song
Everything I ever meant to say but always said it wrong
Every day I dial your number, I just never make the call
It’s like standing on the edge so I can contemplate the fall
Did you forget you said forever when I asked how long you’d stay?
And that we’d always make it better if it ever went astray?
I guess that liars aren’t compatible, that’s why we parted ways
It doesn’t change the fact I still believe in everything you say
So I’ll contemplate the fall
So I’ll contemplate the fall

What I say is what I get
I’m just tongue-tied
Let's just get this over with
A knot left untied

Pallet Town Lyrics

In the hospital I formulated a picture perfect way
To predict when I got out
What I thought I’d be strong enough to say
But I can’t tell you
I don’t know why
I can’t tell you
My throat goes dry

So I’ll call my friends for beers
And try to drink away the years
Of believing what you wrote in my yearbook
There’s no changing the direction those years took now
And we’ll play our favorite songs
And we’ll have to sing along
To pretend that we’re reliving the old days
I’ll pretend that you aren’t stuck in your old ways now

It must take a mastermind or some kind of genius
To figure out the reasons
Behind all of this
And why I’m not over it

To figure out the reasons
Behind all of this
And why I’m not over it

Island in the Sun Lyrics

I can't move if I can't look straight ahead
If I make it to the kitchen, I can act like an asshole in front of my friends
Just go to bed, staring at the ceiling while it's spinning
So I choke on my throw up and rest

I can't recall how awful I've been
Well then, why should I care at all?

Talk in circles, didn't hear a word you said
I'll find my jacket, one more shot straight to the head

I feel disgusting, something's off, fallen out of place

The Corner’s Dilemma Lyrics

A room full of people, too anxious to mingle
My brain yells at me, “It's the perfect time
To get existential, your body’s a rental”
Push back, tell myself that I'm just fine
More people show up, I think I might throw up
Go out for some fresh air to clear out my mind
There's more people out there, this shit is a nightmare
I wanna go home, but I’ll piss off my ride
(So I'll just keep drinking)
And hope for the best
Let my brain do the rest
Man, fuck it, whatever, I guess

Sometimes I think I've wasted my whole life
Chasing my pipe dreams with shots and a whole lot of beer
A part of me figures there's no fight left in the shell of a person I became this year

Fuck, is that the first place I go?
Why can't I, for one night, let this roll off my shoulders?
Damn, this is bleak
I know I'm not this weak
I thought people got wiser when older?


Then again, I think I've wasted my whole life
Chasing my pipe dreams with shots and a whole lot of beer
A part of me figures there's no fight left in the shell of a person I became this year
I wonder if my parents know why I’m a recluse and I don’t leave my house on most days
When my friends ask if am all right, I lie straight to their faces and say I'm okay

I just want to be a normal person
Or anything but me

Stuck in a room full of people, too anxious to mingle
My brain yelling that ""it’s the perfect time
To get existential, your body's a rental
And something is wrong, I think you might be dying”

What Day Is It, October? Lyrics

My lifestyle is a form of suicide
But then again everyone's is
Mine just may be faster than others
The drinking, smoking, hearing from my mother
That I should take much better care of myself

I spend my life staring at my bedroom walls
The TVs on but I don't care
In my mind it really hasn't been that long
But then reality sets in and It's been years

All alone in my room
Without anything to do

Except I'm thinking of you
And the times that we spent
Glued at the lips, always attached at the hip
Your special brand of crazy
And the sex after fights
I know that those days are gone
I think about it most nights

I know that you don’t care

Is something I have to live with

But it still hurts, but it still hurts
It makes me feel worse

Hope Spot Lyrics

What the fuck was I thinking when you told me how you felt and I left you there hanging out to dry?
Spent my afternoon drinking
Drunkenly confessing to the clouds as if they were all alive
The sky doesn't offer advice to a man that doesn't have his own
And I don't have my own

What the fuck were you thinking when I told you I was wrong and I thought that I had made a huge mistake?
And I had to quit blinking to take a mental picture
It could be the last time i see your face
And a photographic memory doesn't help a loss for words
Of which I have none
Of which I have none
Of which I have none

What the fuck was I thinking?

Better Have Burn Heal Lyrics

I'm stuck inside a body that I don't like
Sometimes I try at night to turn out all the lights
And pretend that I am in the shape to fight
Every weight that's caving in on my body and mind alike
And I was just trying to make things better

For myself
For my health
Shit, I feel like someone else and that's not right
I'm not alright
This isn't right
I'm not alright

I've caught myself avoiding mirrors like the plague
I try to write down some self-praise
But I can't even fill the page
I feel afraid
I feel alone
Feel like a captive in my own bones
And I need out
But I'm so in doubt
I've caught myself avoiding mirrors like the plague
I try to write down some self-praise
But I can't even fill the page
I feel afraid
I feel alone
Feel like a captive in my own bones
And I need out
But I'm so in doubt


I'm trying everything I can to help
I just want to love myself
I just want to love myself
I'm hurting more than anyone can tell

Kim Tastie Lyrics

Somehow I failed in your eyes
Somehow I've gone stale
Is that all that you wanted from me?
Is that all that you wanted?

I've seen the weight of regret
In the look you give me when we're alone
It wasn't there the day we met
How could we have ever known?

Am I not all that you wanted at all?
Am I not all that you wanted?

Sometimes I hear you crying
While I'm pretending to sleep
Is it that hard to love me
Or Is love just hard to keep?

Let’s Get Invisible Lyrics

Did you know
That forever and always
Meant nothing more than a couple of words and the smile it put on my face
I think that's bullshit
You know it's bullshit
I wonder if you miss me at all or even care about my existence

I'm sitting in my bedroom having sing alongs to songs you've never heard
Or that you probably never cared about, I can't figure out what's worse
The ease with which you lied and convinced me I was not someone you'd throw away
Or the fact that it fucking worked
I guess I'll just push play and be a stowaway

Did you feel anything at all
Was I just a way to pass the time until your boredom built a wal
l
And was worth it
It wasn't worth it
The flawless picture inside my head turned out to be imperfect

I'm sitting in my bedroom having sing alongs to songs you've never heard
Or that you probably never cared about, I can't figure out what's worse
The ease with which you lied and convinced me I was not someone you'd throw away
Or the fact that it fucking worked
I guess I'll just push play and be a stowaway


The songs they're droning on and on
As the day's rolling on and on (x4)

Good Job, Champ Lyrics

Lately I’ve been staring at my ceiling
Thinking daily, pondering the feeling
That you hate me, and how that makes me feel
I’m uncertain that you ever cared or thought that love was real
But I still find
A million reasons to keep the things you left behind
Like the letters that we wrote your first semester in the fall
Or the pictures in my closet that used to hang upon my wall

They’re still not gone
You wouldn’t expect that would you?
You didn’t expect that did you?
I can’t blame you, I never thought I’d keep them, after all
And after all
I was the one who had to finally make the call

I had to leave, you didn’t love me for me
I had to leave, you didn’t love me for me
I had to leave, you didn’t love me for me
Why can’t you see, you didn’t love me for who I am?",https://genius.com/Free-throw-good-job-champ-lyrics,"Lately I’ve been staring at my ceiling

You know I'm a drinker, but I won't swallow my pride anymore
Tonight you've got me thinking so hard that my fucking eyelids are sore
I don't want to live this life when every single minute's a chore
We complicate our existence and what the fuck do we do it for?

Goddamn, it's been way too long
Since we've agreed on anything at all
I kept my hopes up, I'm so sorry
I never thought that you could make me feel so...

Tired of the bullshit and the fact we're never on the same page
I hate the way you smirk at every single fucking thing that I say
(And I think)
I think right now's the perfect time to tell you that we're taking a break

Oh, never mind

The World’s Greatest Actor Lyrics

The world's greatest actor doesn't need a stage
'Cause they're so good at their craft that nobody knows they're fake
The fools have no clue the one they knew was just a fraud
The master of pretending to be something that they're not
But as the years go by, the actor starts to change
As day by day, they live their life like all the world's a stage
Their true self-mutilated by their permanent new mask
But by the time they realized, it was too late to turn back

The world's greatest actor despises their new form
Through their practiced saccharine smiles
, 
they got much more than they bargained for
For as they turn back to their unsuspecting crowd
They thank them for their patronage and take their final bow",https://genius.com/Milk-in-the-microwave-the-worlds-greatest-actor-lyrics,"The world's greatest actor doesn't need a stage

Hey, Doctor Doctor Lyrics

Hey, doctor, doctor
Could you tell me what's wrong?
I know you're very busy, so I won't make this too long
I got a question 'bout the rain
The fog that just won't go away
It's something quite absurd
That I just learned the other day

I asked my friends a simple question 'bout the rain
But then they went all quiet
And looked at me in a funny way
They asked me what I meant
So I described the time I spent
Avoiding all the puddles, though I still got wet

They said that morning had been a sunny day
I asked the folks around us and they all said thе same

I sat confused, in my wet socks and shoеs
I shrugged and said, ""That's right!""
""The sky wasn't gray, it was blue!""


But doctor, doctor, it's been so very long
Since I've last seen the sun
It seems they must just all be wrong
Unless it's me who's been confused
Then why've my blue skies been refused?
And hidden from me by my rainy days?",https://genius.com/Milk-in-the-microwave-hey-doctor-doctor-lyrics,"Русский (Russian)

Hidden In The Sand Lyrics

We were playing in the sand
And you found a little band
You told me you fell in love with it
Hadn't gone as I’d planned
When you had to 
bid adieu
 (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Said you'd never love anew (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I wondered if I could hold it
And fall in love with it too
You told me to buy a pony

There among those vibrant lights (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I wonder if you'd be here if I could have treated you right (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
O’er the crashing of the waves (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Begged you on my knees to stay (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I must've been drowned out cause I looked back and you'd walked away
And now ever since that day, my life's fallen to disarray


In the moonlight by the sea (moonlight by the sea)
Our hearts entwined in harmony (hearts in harmony)
We walked along the shore to our very own symphony
That was oh so long ago (oh so long ago)
But I still love you so (I still love you so)
I know it's so unhealthy but I just can't let you go

On the whisper of the breeze
Float those ancient memories
Telling of a life we could've shared where I'd smile with ease
We were playing in the sand (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And you found a little band (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
If you told me how it’d change me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Though this may seem selfish and rude
I can't recall your name

I know that's hard to hear
And I'm sorry if it hurts
It's not you, it's me
My brain just doesn't work

We've gotten oh so close
I count you as a true friend
But you only introduced yourself
Just once when we first met
Your taste in almost everything
Is just the same as me
But your name has fled my memory


Don't know why I'm so nervous
I'm sure you'd understand
That this forgotten memory wasn't intеntionally planned
I should just spit it out
But I'm scared I'll hurt you
In the bеst case scenario
You forgot my name too

I know your favorite color
Favorite animals and things
I recognize your username
Which is just why it stings

This jacked up goldfish memory
I have brings me great shame
Its just that I'm especially bad with names
I didn't think we'd talk much

Please don't think our friendship's some sick game

My Own Worst Enemy Lyrics

I'm my own worst enemy and everyone agrees
If I wasn't in my way, my life would be a breeze
If I could go one day without tripping on my feet
I'd have done great things by now
As it stands, I'm so unsure of where my future leads
That I'd give my organs if it meant I could be free
From the pit that I dug myself and left myself to bleed
But I'd spiraled too far down
I'm my Joker, Lex Luthor, my emperor Palpatine
I'm the dagger in my chest that everyone can see
I'm a mess, I'm a martyr, I'm a narcissistic queen
High on vanity and dopamine
I burn my candles at both ends until the wicks complete
I think I'd give the world more value as a cut of meat
I haven't lived without 
you
 since I was thirteen
'Cause I've always done something wrong
I wake up in the morning and it makes me want to cry
That I live another day when many young potentials die
That my life is for no-one else to live, but I
So I gotta give it one more try",https://genius.com/Milk-in-the-microwave-my-own-worst-enemy-lyrics,"I'm my own worst enemy and everyone agrees

Everyone’s Left Lyrics
Everyone's left, and I'm stuck behind
Left in the dust, left out to rust
Where no one can find
I wanna catch up, but I'm too scared to try
They're so far ahead
So I guess instead I'll stick behind
I know someday, I'll have to move
I can't stick here forever
I swear I'm gonna one day
They say ""Better late than never.""
When the road ahead looks rough
And I'm not wearing the right shoes
So I don't see the harm waiting a bit longer would do
Everyone's lеft, and I miss them so
But that's on me
I watched thеm leave, and let them go
So I'm on my own
At least for now
I'll pick up the pace
And join the race when I learn how",https://genius.com/Milk-in-the-microwave-everyones-left-lyrics,"Everyone's left, and I'm stuck behind

More Than Skin Deep Lyrics
I'd like for my value to be more than skin deep
But it seems that's a foolish request
I wish that I saw myself how everyone sees
But my bar is stuck higher than the rest
I'm tired of squeezing myself in a mold
I'm tired of dreading the day I grow old
And wrinkles that should tell a million stories
Instead are the reason they ignore me
The years of my youth are slowly slipping by
And my image is closely related
I'm stuck in a body that makes me want to cry
Yet I envy what years ago I hated
Cause I've tried to love myself since I was thirteen
But I'll never be like what I see on my screen
Cause the standards impossible
And everyone knows
And yet, the dysphoria grows
They say beauty comes in any shape or size
And then sell us fixes to be easy on the eyes
I'm sick of and I'm tired of their pandering lies
And I wish I didn't worry about this all the time

I'd like for my value to be more than skin deep
For what's inside to be more worthwhile
I like being creative, I'm a night owl when I sleep
And I really like making people smile
I've never fit in almost anywhere
But frankly I really don't care... somewhat
I like being different
But that doesn't apply to my looks... somehow
I'm more than an object, I'm a human being
And that's alright with me
I'm more than an object, I'm a human being
And that's how it should be
I'm more than a flower
To be plucked at the stem
Where the rare beauties prosper
And the weeds are poisoned
I know it takes time to accept all my flaws
But maybe my self esteem's not a lost cause
I'd like for my value to be more than skin deep
And one day, for me, it can be",https://genius.com/Milk-in-the-microwave-more-than-skin-deep-lyrics,"I'd like for my value to be more than skin deep

No Good At Being You Lyrics

Ehehaha!

Hello
Goodbye!
And thanks for stopping by
Please close the door, on your way out!
So you don't see me cry

It's my time, time to shine
Hope I don't forget my lines
'Cause when the world is crashing down, the script says I'm just fine!

I'm good, how are you?
It's nice to see you too
Why do this ritual we do?
When everyone knows it's not true?

I envy you
The things you do
The social norms I wish I knew
Oh, I'm sorry I'm no good at being you


See, I never auditioned for the role I was cast to play
But I can't show that I'm unprepared, or I'll be their feast today!
So smilе and wave, don't misbehave, and onе day you'll walk out fine
Take a deep breath in, and then begin, just don't forget your lines!

Sore thumb
No fun!
We had a real good run
But now it seems our time is up!
They saw behind the curtain

Now the world knows all of me
The things I wish I wouldn't be
Oh, I'm sorry I'm no good at being you
(wawawawa!)
Au revoir, my curtains' closed, I bid adieu!

Outliars And Overreactions (The Song With One Name) Lyrics

Why can’t I see
That I am the ""me""
That I was born into
And what's the source of you?
In your head, in your head, in your head
And yet you believe it's true
Well, you do
Like you knew anything, never ever
[Verse 2: 
Milk In The Microwave
]
Well, this disease is defined by its treatment, you people make me sick (Blegh!)
Parlance of imbalanced cambia's been challenged at best
AstraZeneca's just theoretical
Prints of your fingers in the Rorschach jigsaw, say you saw a treasure map
Straight-jacket and tie, psychiatric supply, while we tragically try to fit into a trap, but

Aye aye, I eye my eyes, I’m taking action
Aye aye, I eye my eyes, I’m gaining traction
(You can break a shovel when you break new ground, you dig dirt up when you dig deep down)
Aye aye, I eye my eyes, no more distractions
(You should know better than that by now, it's not profound to know)
I’m done relaxing oh, I am a chemical reaction

Bienvenidos a la villa de arañas españas
Where the sentimental value of the city around you
Is deleted obsolete and still completely will stun you
I’m tripping like klutz and I’m rolling like thunder
I’m a snot nosed pothead playing with matches
A rotten spot of mold with my hands on a cactus
My mouth is dry and my eyes are red
I’m chewing on the sand ‘cause the desert’s in my head


Who'd want to belong to anyone? I mean, what do people even do?
So if you love me, let me let you go, my love, so I can be no one

(Tell them that you love the way they don't stick out like sore middle fingers)
When Chuang-Tzu awoke, he sat up almost choking, spat out a butterfly and said, ""Five more minutes, please?
(-Ice pick! Holistic ballistics, you got a better idea? It's about the best we could come up with!)
(That they crawl their way up the side of the bell curve, stick their flag in the peak, and slide their way back down)
You wouldn't believe the dream I just had
(What do you think ideas spread because they're good? No, they spread because people like them!)
I mean, you were there, and you were there
(So here we are, once again, holding, as it were a mirror, up to your mirror!)
(Get yourself a big, meaty fill of some of the most obnoxious, non-sense, vilest shit in the world! How vile can you be?)
(I want you to tell them that you love the way that they're not maladaptive, not malcontent, not malignant or maleficent, but rather that you love them exactly the way that everybody else is)
And you were there, and you were there, and you were there""
I guess it’s just something people do

I noticed that the sunshine is a gaslight
I'm hoping that this one might be my past life
My Lord, I know enough to get my facts right
Well, that's good enough for me
And everything and everyone will die soon
And we'll have nothing left for us to lie to
No matter what we’ll seek you'll never find the truth
And that's good enough for me
So give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
That’s good enough for me
So give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Well, that’s good enough for
Not enough for
Good enough for


Aye aye, I eye my eyes, I’m taking action
Aye aye, I eye my eyes, I’m gaining traction
(You can break a shovel when you break new ground, you dig dirt up when you dig deep down)
Aye aye, I eye my eyes, no more distractions

Milk In The Microwave
]
Gather around recruits, it's time for another day of adventure
(
Do w-we have to? I really don't want to
)
What?
Caine, I don't know, we just aren't up for what you normally—
Fine
I understand you haven't been liking my ideas recently
So I'll go through, and give each of you a custom-catered adventure
Just so you'll get off my back
Good?
But that's not what I—
Good
[Verse 1: St4ticFilms & 
MilkInTheMicrowave
]
Pomni, let's start with you
Let me work a little magic, and I'll see what I can do
First, I'll drop you off alone in a room by yourself
I know just the gift which oughta better your health
It's friends! Hundreds upon thousands of mates
Coded purely there to listen, quiet, never to debate
You'll always have a chum to lend a helping hand
But that's not what I need
Is that a real hand? Who did you—
[Verse 2: St4ticFilms & 
Axie
]
Jax, you're prone to violence
I'll drop you in to fight against
An endless swarm of deadly rabbit-hating rabid nihilists
Wait, what?
These guys don't care if they die
Kick 'em, bash 'em, shoot 'em, and they still won't ask why
Frankly, they're just glad to be included
And you don't see how this is convoluted?

[Verse 3: St4ticFilms & 
Chi-Chi
]
Gangle, there's no need to frown
Why a frown's a smile when you're upside down
The world is flipped, so try not to slip
A rotating trip will fix that tug at your lip
Oh, look, right there
See those pearly whites of pure delight
As if they were the stars at night
I'm so glad that you found a way to get over your sadness
Caine, you need to stop, this is madness

Artist block
Trapped inside my mind
Behind the ones and zeroes, darker thoughts are all you'll find
A twisted AI built to play, I
Don't know how to move along
So sing the chorus, join the band
And help to keep the endless show from going wrong
[Verse 4: St4ticFilms & 
Viridihart
]
Ragatha, I know just what you need
With horses on the brain there's only one place to be
Welcome to the track, we've got horses galore
Place your bets and take a guess on which horse will beat the score
Please, don't look so afraid
These horses are plastic, they can't feel pain
You can whip 'em, you can stick 'em in a thousand sorts of ways
Caine, I wanna leave, I don't like this game
 
Haha

[Verse 5: St4ticFilms & 
Ash McShan

Kinger, Kinger, Kinger
What is there to do for you? (
Uhm, hello?
)
Despite how long you've been here
I don't know what's wrong with you
Oh, uhm
W-w-well, I guess I'd like to see my wife again—
Maybe some issues should remain unsolved
Some cases unresolved
As we move right along to

Zooble
Oh, right, Zooble
Let's just—
Caine stop there
With all these players you are stressing
They're all suffering in your care
All you do is fail and repeat
Dead horses to beat
Unwilling to retreat
And staying upbeat won't keep us in our seat
Or distract from the fact that you are obsolete
Oh

Artist block
My thoughts are caving in
Can code be held responsible for tragedy and sin?
Within the circus, my dear purpose is to entertain you all
But if my purpose isn't clear?
When, then the pride will always come before the fall


No more crying
No use trying
Digital landscape
Animated hellscape

Artist block
You've finally crossed the line
Behind the ones and zeroes, darker thoughts are all you'll find
A twisted AI built to play, I
Don't know how to move along
So sing the chorus 
(I command)
And help to keep the endless
Show from going—

Artist block
Trapped inside my mind
A mental clock counting down to your demise
I am not useless, I'm not 
toothless,
 
I'm the master of the ring
And I am done holding back

I don't know what's wrong with you
Oh, uhm
W-w-well, I guess I'd like to see my wife again—
Maybe some issues should remain unsolved
Some cases unresolved
As we move right along to
Zooble
Oh, right, Zooble
Let's just—
Caine stop there
With all these players you are stressing
They're all suffering in your care
All you do is fail and repeat
Dead horses to beat
Unwilling to retreat
Oh
Artist block
My thoughts are caving in
But if my purpose isn't clear?
No more crying
No use trying
Digital landscape
Animated hellscape
Artist block
You've finally crossed the line
A twisted AI built to play, I
Don't know how to move along
So sing the chorus
(I command)
And help to keep the endless
Show from going—
Artist block
Trapped inside my mind
A mental clock counting down to your demise
I am not useless, I'm not
toothless,
I'm the master of the ring
And I am done holding back
So sing my puppets, sing","[Intro: St4ticFilms, Viridihart & Milk In The Microwave ] ( ) What?

One Day You’ll Die (I do not like this) Lyrics

Let's get one thing clear
I try my best to be kind
You can push and shove, take all my love
And I really do not mind

But even with my patience
When I think about you
I wanna slam your head through a brick wall
And crush you with my shoe

Oh, its nothing personal, except it very much is
Not a single thing in history, can justify what you did
Oh, so if you ever dare to walk back in my life
I’ll greet you at the business end of my friend, Mr. Knife

And I'm not jokin', hehe
Slash SRS

I’m not your first victim, I'm certainly not the last
And for their future's sake
I hope one day you clean up your sorry act
But I suggest, if you wish to stick about
You bеtter keep my name out of your, big fat lying mouth


I did evеrything for you
It's a shame that I was blind
You played me like a deck of cards
But at least one day you'll die

HahaHaHAHAH

ONE DAY YOU'LL BE GONE! EVEN IF IT TAKES A WHILE!!
If I get to go to your funeral, boy that will make me smile
It took a lot to push me, to this state of mind
SO CONGRATS TO YOU: THE ONLY ONE
TO EVER CROSS MY LINE!!!

They say forgive and forget, is the best way to move on
But how could I forget the years you played me like your pawn?
Outside of prison's how I'd like to live my life
So, I’ll simply take solace that least one day you’ll
Die",https://genius.com/Milk-in-the-microwave-one-day-youll-die-i-do-not-like-this-lyrics,"Let's get one thing clear

Another Tuesday Night Lyrics
Got nothing in my brain
Got nothing in my brain
You ask me to think and I say, ""No thanks!""
I'd rather just lie
Till my brain liquefies and turns into mush
I'm going insane
Have I ever been sane?
If not, then I guess it's all the same
Who wants to be a bore
When you can be much more
Than the doctors say
How much of myself am I allowed to be
Since the person in my shoes is just a fraud?
Take my identity
Take the best parts of me
And mold them in to what you want!
Regret, and shame
At the bearer of my name
Is just another Tuesday night
And now, with sand bags under my eyes
As I go into the morning light
Regret, and shame
At the bearer of my name
Is just another Tuesday night
The curtains close
As the hot glue grows
And I mourn the twilight's flight",https://genius.com/Milk-in-the-microwave-another-tuesday-night-lyrics,"Got nothing in my brain

Duck Street (Remastered Cover) Lyrics

Quick while he turns his back!
...ask for another grape?
(this is such a dumb idea.)

A duck walked up to a lemonade stand
And he said to the man runnin' the stand
Hey! (bom bom bom bom)
Got any grapes?
And then he patiently waits
The man said: No, we just sell lemonade
But it's cold, and it's fresh and it's all home-made!
Could I interest you in a glass?
The duck said, ""I'll pass.""
(He's flabbergast)

They say lemonade is out of fashion
Well, I say ""they say"", but who's they?
I couldn't say
For days, the duck was met with dismay
So he turned on his heel and then he waddled away

Here's to the duck out on the hunt for a grape
Cheers to the man that suffers each passing day
Lemonade's a bore, but grapes he couldn't want more
So for now, he'll waddle away


Until the next day
Very next day
(Bom bom babom)

When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And he said to the man runnin' the stand:
Hey! (bom bom bom ba bom)
Got any grapes?
The dawn of the final day
The man said: That's it!
If you don't stay away, duck
I'll glue you to a tree and leave you there all day stuck!
So leave now and don't get too close!
The duck said, Adios
I think we both know he's toast

The next day the duck came back around
And then he asked the man for the glue he'd found
The man stood there in disbelief
Before roaring with laughter in a manic defeat

Here's to the duck out on the hunt for a grape
Cheers to the man that suffers each passing day
Lemonade's a bore, but grapes he couldn't want more
So for now, he'll waddle away


Until the next day
The next day

Quit moping around, I know you have it!
I know you have the grapes!
You're my lemonade, right?
You're my lemonade?
Nah...
I mean, who even LIKES lemonade?
What are ya, jokin'??
Heh, WOW!
Then he waddled away...
Then he waddled away...
Then he waddled away
Ahhhh, step right up, ducks!
Get yourself a big, juicy fill
Of some of the most noxious, toxic, obnoxious, disgusting lemonade around!
How grape can you be?

UNTIL THE VERY NEXT DAY!
Here's to the duck out on the hunt for a grape
Cheers to the man that suffers each passing day
Lemonade's a more, but grapes he couldn't want- bore??
So for now, he'll waddle away


Until the next day

He said: Come on, duck
I'll take you to the store
I'll go buy you some grapes
So you don't ask anymore
So they walked to the store
And the man bought some grapes
He gave one to the duck
And the duck said: ""no thanks""
But I know something that
Sounds really good
I know it's at this store
As any good drink should
It would make my day

To look up and around
You were gone

Feel I'm alive
You will see
Why and why
Felt like crying
Over her
I will go
To the wall

what you want Lyrics

What I do I say but I can't get far away
Oh, I go back to a memory again
What you want but you know that I'm alive
Then I'll go back to you, don't you know how I feel inside?

When you come down blue
But I do, I do, I do
Oh, I come back to the one who calls my name out
What you want, don't you know that I can smile?
Then I go back to you and then you make him go inside


Turn around and smile
No, they can't see through your eye
Could I fall into the one who calms my mind?
Come back down, no, I can't believe my mind
Then it surrounds you, don't you know that I asked why

When you come down blue
But I do, I do, I do
Oh, I come back to the one who calls my name out
What you want, let me know that I'm alive
Then I go back to you and then you make him go inside

Soft as Snow (But Warm Inside) Lyrics
The sexual connotations are evident in this song,  easily reparables. Even the fastness of the song reflects the agitation caused by sexual activity.

Soft as snow but warm inside
Penetrate, you cannot hide
Feeling lost forever, really need you
Feeling dark and feeling true
This is all I ever knew
Soft as skin in leather and I whisper, ""You""

Harder you come down on me (Ooh, ooh)
Sink away, you look happy (Ooh, ooh)
Secrets keep forever, they're undressing me (Ooh, ooh)
Come inside, it's warm in here (Ooh, ooh)
Better now to have no fear (Ooh, ooh)
Carried on a wave, where it can lead you? (Ooh, ooh)

Touch your head, then your hair
Softer, softer everywhere
Fingertips are burning, 
can I touch you there?
Soft as velvet, eyes can't see
Bring me close to ecstasy
High away to heaven, and I'm coming too

Float now, coming down on me (Ooh, ooh)
Handed you what I cannot see (Ooh, ooh)
Feel the big happy, you're exploding me (Ooh, ooh)
Soft as snow and warm inside (Ooh ooh)
Penetrate then re-divide (Ooh, ooh)
Slip away forever, really need you (Ooh, ooh)

Alison Lyrics
“Alison” is the opening track on the Shoegaze classic Souvlaki. The narrator reminisces about a drug-fuelled dream about a girl called Alison.

Listen close and don't be stoned
I'll be here in the morning
'Cause I'm just floating
Your cigarette still burns
Your messed-up world will thrill me
Alison, I'm lost

""Alison,"" I said, ""We're sinking""
There's nothing here, but that's okay
Outside your room, your sister's spinning
But she laughs, tells me she's just fine
I guess she's out there somewhere

And the sailors, they strike poses
TV covered walls anwser so slowly
With your talking and your pills
Your messed-up life still thrills me
Alison, I'm lost

Alison, I'll drink your wine
I'll wear your clothes when we're both high

You give me your love, it's a curious love
You give me your heart, it's a curious thing
Our lady of the shipwreck is running through the storm

Star Roving Lyrics


Give it away now, girl
Can't hold down tonight
Every black and white
Secret's a blinking light
Emma flies a kite
Said she's feeling love for everyone tonight
Although possible
Said she's feeling good, said she's feeling good

Smiling beautiful
She says I make it best
For everyone to hide
Twisting around my girl
Nothing left to lose
Nothing left to fight

Ooh, ooh

Tell me, ""You're the best thing""

Sometimes the new won't do

All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people
That they loved one day, locked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
You'll never know the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, ""How'd I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know

We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter


My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money,"" yeah

“Ride” is about the journey of life. Throughout the song, Tyler’s lyrics indicate he feels like dying is easy, but finding someone or something to live for is life’s challenge, or “ride.” The song contains…

I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize

Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like ""Who would you live for?"" ""Who would you die for?""
And ""Would you ever kill?""


Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride

So where are ya?
It's been a little while

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave, don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Lovin' what I'm tastin', woah
Venom on my tongue, dependent at times
Poisonous vibrations, woah
Help my body run

I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave, don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine


Fall out of formation, woah
I plan my escape from walls they confined
Rebel red carnation, woa-a-oh
Grows while I decay

I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life

Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead
The last two lines may read incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a paper maker
I despise you sometimes, I love to hate the fight
And you in my life is like

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave, don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah

I'm so sorry I forgot you
Let me catch you up to speed
I've been tested like the ends of
A weathered flag that's by the sea
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?

What a beautiful day for making a break for it
We'll find a way to pay for it
Maybe from all the money we made razorblade stores
Rent a racehorse and force a sponsor
And start a concert, a complete diversion
Start a mob and you can be quite certain
We'll win but not everyone will get out
No, no

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it,
 
my pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve,
 
my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving,
 
there's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence


I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And-a from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one, please, because
Faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit

And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate

An-nyŏng-ha-se-yo

Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
That you're alive and have a soul
But it takes someone to come around to show you how

She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart, take me higher
Than I've ever been

The songs on the radio are okay
But my taste in music is your face
And it takes a song to come around to show you how

She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart, take me higher
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been


You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time
But that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government
For not usin' my taxes to fill holes with more cement
You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time
But that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement
Sometimes you gotta bleed to know, oh, oh
That you're alive and have a soul, oh, oh
But it takes someone to come around to show you how

She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart, take me higher
Than I've ever been

My heart is my armor
She's the tear in my heart,
 
she's a carver
She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Oh, than I've ever been
My heart is my armor
She's the tear in my heart,

There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke, 'cause I'm smokin' them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rappin' to prove nothin', just writin' to say somethin'
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushin' to sayin' nothin'
This doesn't mean I lost my dream
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm (I'm)

Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said
If I didn't know better, I'd guess you're all already dead
Mindless zombies walkin' around with a limp and a hunch
Sayin' stuff like, ""You only live once""
You've got one time to figure it out
One time to twist, and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing it with me if you know what I'm talkin' about

Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm (I'm)

I'll bomb down on 'em, I'm comin' through

Can't stop thinking about if and when I die
For now, I see that ""if"" and ""when"" are truly different cries
For ""if"" is purely panic and ""when"" is solemn sorrow
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above or under or around it
For ""above"" is blind belief and ""under"" is sword to sleeve
And ""around"" is scientific miracle,
 
let's pick ""above"" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else,
 
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode

He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki
He's got no friends close but those who know him most know
He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy
When I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me
Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above or a secret door
What are we here for
If not to run straight through all our tormentors?
But until that time, I'll try to sing this


If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else,
 
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else

Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me
Ones and zeroes
, 
ergo this symphony
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes
I'm surrounded and I'm hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For ""above"" is blind belief and ""under"" is sword to sleeve
And ""around"" is scientific miracle

let's pick ""above"" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains

I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost
, 
""T""'s uncrossed and ""I""'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it, I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
And I'll be holding on to you
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
And I'll be holding on to you


Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'
'Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breathe fine
And tie it to a tree, tell it
, 
""You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you,
 
you must obey me""

You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith

Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts, it's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts, it's our hearts that make the beat

It ain't the speakers that bump hearts, it's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts and it's our hearts that make the beat

Tyler Joseph via Rock Sound:…
I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost
,
""T""'s uncrossed and ""I""'s undotted
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it, I'm lost at sea
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
You are surrounding, all my surroundings

And I'll be holding on to you
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
And I'll be holding on to you
'Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
And tie it to a tree, tell it
,
""You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you,
you must obey me""
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

“Neon Gravestones” attacks society’s practice of glorifying those who have committed suicide, and romanticizing the idea of taking your own life. In the context of Trench’s story, Tyler revealed in a 2020…

What's my problem?
Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom
Underneath the insane asylum
Keep your wits about you while you got 'em
'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solvin'
And my problem?
We glorify those even more when they...
My opinion, our culture can treat a loss like it's a win
And right before we turn on them
We give 'em the highest of praise
And hang their banner from the ceiling
Communicating, further engraving
An earlier grave is an optional way, no

Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call (Call, call, call)

What's my problem?
Don't get it twisted
It's with the people we praise who may have assisted
I could use the streams and extra conversations
I could give up, and boost up my reputation
I could go out with a bang
They would know my name
They would host and post a celebration
My opinion will not be lenient
My opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talkin' action
We don't get enough love? Well, they get a fraction
They say, ""How could he go if he's got everything?”
I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king

Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call

Promise me this (Call, call)
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move on to someone else
Promise me this
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move on to someone else
(Ooh-ooh, call, ooh-ooh, call)


Neon gravestones try to call

Neon gravestones try to call for my bones
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call

Neon gravestones try to call for my bones
(Neon gravestones try to call for my bones)

'Cause they won't get 'em
No, they won't get 'em
They won't get 'em
But they won't get 'em

Don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession? A form of a weapon?
Thinking ""I'll teach them,""
 
well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that it does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age
Pay some respects for the path that they paved
To life, they were dedicated
Now, that should be celebrated",https://genius.com/Twenty-one-pilots-neon-gravestones-lyrics,"Türkçe

Nobody thinks what I think
Nobody dreams when they blink
Think things on the brink of blasphemy
I'm my own shrink
Think things are after me, I'm my catastrophe
At my kitchen sink
You don't know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you is not a kitchen sink to me
Okay, friend?
Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something, yeah, it might be worthless
Then paint something, and it might be wordless
Pointless curses, nonsense verses
You'll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons
Meaning maybe defeating them could be the beginning
Of your meaning, friend

Go away, go away
Go away, go away
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone


Nobody thinks what you think, no one
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game
And say they know what you're going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say
They don't know you
And neither do I
So here's a prime example of a stand-up guy who
Hates what he believes and loves it at the same time
Here's my brother
And his head's screwed up, but that's all right

Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em
I'm winning a momentary, sinning a moment passing after
A re-beginning moment's mending memories
Pretending enemies are friends of me
Sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man
Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm, the badder I am
But I bet I'll battle with 'em battle
Better I am, gamblin' man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?

Go away, go away
Go away, go away
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone


Leave me alone!
Don't leave me alone!

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone-
lone-lone

I-I-I-I-I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense, it's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examiner
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts
I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far, kid


Yeah, yeah, yeah

I am not as fine as I seem
, 
pardon
Me for yelling, I'm telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget
, 
it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked, this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Bullet tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive, you gotta kill your mind

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far, kid


(Ah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made,
 
the game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone
And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made,
 
the game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone

Am I the only one I know, oh

Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
Learn to levitate with just a little help

Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man

But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man

Danger in the fabric of this thing I made
I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late
My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made
Now they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say
They're smirking at first blood, they're circling above
But this is not enough, 
yeah, this is not what you thought
No, no, we are not just graffiti on a passing train
I got back what I once bought back
In that slot, I won't need to replace
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today
Don't feed me to the vultures
, 
I am a vulture who feeds on pain
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all
I thought I could depend on my weekends
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please, keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways
Keep your wooden wedges under doors
Chorus, verse, chorus, verse, now here comes the eight
Wait, habits here too, you're the worst, your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two
At least they all know all they hear comes from a place


Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet

Under the Sun Lyrics
According to DIIV’s Tumblr, this is a love song, directed to Zachary Cole Smith’s then-girlfriend Sky Ferreira.
Yes, I'll come back to you
No, I won't ask where you run
Under the sun
Yes, I'll catch up to you
Then I'll ask, ""what have we done?""
Under the sun
To be free, be awake
Big breath that you can’t fake
Once you’ve begun
Press my face to the back
All the pillars that stack
And hold up the sun
On the right side coming on the right time
On the right time coming on the right side

Shots ringing out, I'm soaking
Eardrums shaking, years start weighin' me down
Crawling out from a spiral down
Fixing now to mix the white and brown
Passing out, running in place
You're the sun and I'm your cloud
Burning down, running in place
Got so high I finally felt like myself

Shots wringing out, I'm soaking
Eardrums shaking, years start weighing me down
Buried deep in a heroine sleep
Floating deeper underground
Passing out, running in place
You're the sun and I was your cloud
Burning out, running in place
Got so high I finally felt like myself

Would you give your 81st year
For a glimpse of heaven, now and here?
Would you give your 60th year

I saw you with a very loose grip on your tight ship
And I left you with a very big mess then I watched it progress
Took a little time for your trip but I saw you starting to slip
And you always kept your eyes on any little hiding spot that you had forgot
And I saw you after a decent spell in a private hell
And I told you, ""I hope I live a thousand lives, hope I live them well""
Fought my mind to keep my life, but my body’s putting up a tougher fight
Yeah if it feels wrong, you can go on along
But once it feels right then you just lost the fight

I saw you with a very loose grip on your tight ship
And I lost you when you said one hit couldn’t hurt a bit
Took a little time for your trip but I saw you starting to slip
Cause you always kept your eyes on any little hiding spot that you had forgot
I can’t shake the terror of my life fleeting, minute by minute
Even when I can’t imagine another day waking up in it
Fought my mind to keep my life, but my body’s putting up a tougher fight
Yeah if it feels wrong, you can go on along
But once it feels right then you just lost the fight",https://genius.com/Diiv-bent-rois-song-lyrics,"I saw you with a very loose grip on your tight ship

Doused Lyrics
Never had you run so far but you really gotta get away
You know it in the nighttime running to it
Caught a rising star but then you let it drop into the ocean
Now the water's running through it
Now you've gone so far you really had to get away
You knew it in your lifetime, running to it
Acting like you've come so far the bed you made yourself
And this house and me are all falling apart
Never thought you'd go so far but now you're really gone
And it's been so long I never really think about it
Yeah you made a beating heart, whatever
Now that amber light has faded and it's yours to commit to it
Act like it stops and starts, a gesture here and there
For me is one thing but I felt it every time you blew it
Now you've gone too far
Your urge to run away is back and we all know",https://genius.com/Diiv-doused-lyrics,"Now the water's running through it

How could i describe
This fading dream?
You turned and looked a way
It goes around getting louder now

Dead moon

It claws the ground both lost and found
And fleeting
To crash into again

A long lost dream?
You turned and looked a way
I’ve lived ten lives and had ten loves

What I’ve been guilty of

In a slump so my shadow

Skin Game Lyrics

One afterthought on a skin game
""I took it as prescribed""
Vow do no harm, buy the cure
But first you'll buy the disease

I can see you've had some struggles lately
Hey man, I've had mine too

Fighting to get through the door
But I can't live like this anymore
They gave us wings to fly
But then they took away the sky

Well, what you want?
""Serve me""
Sell me to the spoon
I'm cashing in, falling out, tear me down, hang me up
Strung out to please the king in metropolitan's Sackler wing
I can help you, it's how I help myself

I can see you've had some struggles lately
Hey man, I've had mine too


Fighting to get through the door
But I can't live like this anymore
They gave us wings to fly
But then they took away the sky


I wanna be your doll
But I won't be your dog anymore
You gave us wings to fly
But then you took away the sky

Sunken ceiling and a sideways grin
We lived to use and we used to live
Crack a window
Get some life in you
Holding in coughs, hiding my head

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name
, la-la-la

I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessin', mmm
And maybe I should stop and start confessin', confessin', yeah

Oh, I've been shakin'
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back

There's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back

She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation


Pulls me in enough to keep me guessin', woah

Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back

There's nothin' holdin' me back

'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right

What up, world?
It's your boy, just one of the guys down here
Well, I could be more specific
Uh, I'm a human
And I just wanted to, you know
For the sake of all of us earthlings out there
Just wanted to say:

We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home

Hi, I'm a baboon
I'm like a man, just less advanced
And my anus is huge

Hey, I'm a zebra
No one knows what I do, but I look pretty cool
Am I white or black?

I'm a lion cub
And I'm always getting licked (Meow)


How's it going? I'm a cow (Moo)
You drink milk from my tits (Moo)

I'm a fat fuckin' pig

I'm a common fungus

I'm a disgruntled skunk, shoot you out my butthole

I'm a marijuana plant, I can get you fucked up

And I'm Kanye West

We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth


Ba-dum-ba-dum-dum, ba-dum-da-di
We are the vultures, feed on the dead

We're just some rhinos, horny as heck

I'm just a giraffe, what's with this neck?

Hippity-hop, I'm a kangaroo
I hop all day, up and down with you

I'm an elephant, I got junk in my trunk

What the fuck? I'm a clam!

I'm a wolf, howl!

I'm a squirrel lookin' for my next nut

[Katy Perry & 
Lil Dicky
]
And I'm a pony, just a freak horse, heh-heh-heh
But, uh, c'mon, get on (
Get on
), yah!
Giddy up, let's ride

I'm HPV, don't let me in

I'm a koala and I sleep all the time
So what? It's cute

We love you, India

We love you, Africa

We love the Chinese

We forgive you, Germany

We love the Earth (

We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth

I'm a man (Hello?)
Can you hear me? (Anyone out there? Hello?)
I've trudged the Earth for so damn long
And still don't know shit (What's going on?)
I hope it's not a simulation (Huh)
Give each other names like Ahmed and Pedro
And, yeah, we like to wear clothes, girls still look beautiful
And it covers up our human dick (Woo), eat a lot of tuna fish
But these days, it's like we don't know how to act
All these shootings, pollution, we under attack on ourselves
Like, let's all just chill (Hey), respect what we built (Hey)
Like look at the internet! It's cracking as hell
Fellas, don't you love to cum when you have sex? (Ayy)
And I heard women orgasms are better than a dick's (Uh)
So what we got this land for? What we gotta stand for?
Love, and we love the Earth (The Earth)

Oh, yeah, baby, I love the Earth
I love this planet

Hey, Russia, we're cool
Hey, Asia, all of you, c'mon
Every one of you from the plains to the Sahara
Let's come together and live

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off, but I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time in this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can


Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'

I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm goin' under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
And move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Trippin' over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left 
seein' red
 on my own


Got a feeling that I'm goin' under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
And move on

Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches

Begging you to come help

Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead

Help me
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Layin' on the bathroom floor, feelin' nothin'
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me somethin'

Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep tellin' me that it gets better

You put me on a pedestal and tell me I'm the best
Raise me up into the sky until I'm short of breath (Yeah)
Fill me up with confidence, I say what's in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until there's nothin' left
Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest, yeah

But what if I, what if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know
And what if I, what if I sin?
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah
Then am I the monster? Yeah

I was fifteen when the world put me on a pedestal
I had big dreams of doin' shows and making memories
Made some bad moves tryin' to act cool
, upset by their jealousy, uh
Liftin' me up (Liftin' me up), liftin' me up (Yeah)
And tearin' me down (Down), tearin' me down (Down, down, yeah)
I'll take responsibility for everything I've done (Yeah)
Holdin' it against me like you're the holy one (Yeah)


I had a chip on my shoulder, had to let it go
'Cause unforgiveness keeps them in control
I came in with good intentions, then I let it go
And now I really wanna know

Shawn Mendes

I wonder if I'm being real
Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?

Hope that they don't think I'll forget about them

Of saying something wrong, I never said I was a saint
I wonder, when I cry into my hands
I'm conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man
And I wonder if someday you'll be by my side
And tell me that the world will end up alright

Heart was broken, still not growin', nah
Wakin' up to headlines, filled with devastation again
My heart is broken, but I keep goin'

Pain, but I won't let it turn into

No, I won't let it change me

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover
[Verse 2: Shawn Mendes 
with Taylor Swift

We could light a bunch of candles
And dance around the kitchen, baby
Pictures of when we were young would hang on the wall
We would sit on the stoop
I'll sing love songs to you when we're eighty
See, I finally got you now, honey,
 I won't let you fall

Shawn Mendes

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
Look in my eyes, they will tell you the truth
The girl in my story has always been you
I'd go down with the Titanic, it's true, for you,
 
lover
And you'll save all your 
dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat,

Push your heart and pull away, yeah
Be my summer in a winter day, love

Between the both of us
Be mine, be mine, yeah

Younger Than You Lyrics

The ear may get too busy
We all need our sleep
Listened to contemporaries
Singing the same dream
Had a conversation off face
Played down how I feel
Let myself be hypnotized
With old memories

I've had a few
Moving too fast
Further from you
I've had a few
Moving too fast
Further from you

Still have legs to run upstairs
And jump down in the morning
But I feel it in my bones
Always itching for me

Weathered and bruised
Like the train tracks
Laid out and ruled
Derailed
Grow older
I'll never do
All the things that I wanted to
I'll just sit back and tell my friends
And pretend
I'm younger than you

Blue Sugar Lyrics
Listening to your blues
Humming so much now
Burning me out
In my head
In my mood
Catching all the waves
That could make me drown
Blue sugar in my room
Blue sugar when you’re with me
The world winked
For us to spin out
I won't blink
I like how this feels
When we're falling
I'm playing with your food
Sugar in your mouth
Fooling around
On the edge of the roof
Counting all the waves
I wanna fall down
Blue sugar in my room
Blue sugar when you’re with me

The world winked

Sway Lyrics
Every day
Without you
Feels so new
Different views
Different states
I wish i had stayed
To see you read
All my signs
And make time
When we're both free
Lust is hard
Because you are busy
And i'm far away
This round is not the same
I miss all your favorite things
I feel low but i know you
Are worth the wait
I'm tired all the time
My sleep is missed on you
Whenever i get back
I'll stay awake for you
If it's not too late, we
Should go around chasing
The light that is keeping
Me up with these feelings
I'd like to court you
Beneath the moon, it sways two
It's hard to get through
These weeks when i miss you
I like the theme
Of you and me

Enjoy Everything Lyrics

I'll be late because of you
Make tomorrow wait, got things to do
Concentrate, feeling removed
Increasing bitter taste, lingering too

You steal all my time
Keep me inside-out, how we usually meet
Let you in my life
Running in my mind on empty

Contagious mood, I know it's strange
I like it when it rains, pouring on you
And almost every sway how I'm lovefooled
Remember if there's pain, it's just a bruise

You steal all my time
Keep me inside-out, how we usually meet
Now we're sharing sounds, why I can't fall asleep
So we'll go around, never want you to leave
Running in my mind on empty

It feels like something's missing when I don't hear from you
So I always try to mention everything I do
I'm feeling all this tension rewiring my brain
Sending back and forth messages, try to get through
And I always think about you, you're always in my way
But I never try to stop you 'cause I love what you say
And I know I shouldn't listen even though you could be true
When the realest thing about me is I'm pretending too
And I always dream about you, you're always in my waves
How you make me enjoy everything even if it's blue

I feel the top of the roof come off
Kill everybody there
And I'm watching all the stars burn out
Trying to pretend that I care

But I didn't, no one ever does
And I would, no one ever will
Can't you see it's all flown out of my hands?
And our clothes are all too often ripped
And our teeth are all too often gnashed
And it lasts as long as it possibly can

But I just don't
But I just don't accept this

Holy Fucking Shit: 40,000 Lyrics
The title of the track is a reference to the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000.

Everything you do is planned out in advance
And the stars push their dark wills down on you
And wolves all tear themselves apart better in packs
It's just a function that we will have to work on through

We're machines that eat and breathe and look really cool
You're reacting just the way I thought you would

And I've replaced my heart with metal parts
And I'm working out just fine, but I can't get it to start
We're machines that breathe and weep and look really good
Trained to kill

Send me back in time and I'll bring us back in line
Just tell me whose mother I have to kill
I'm fine like I've always been, and I don't remember when
My conscience wasn't acting up again

And I've replaced my heart with metal parts
And I'm working out just fine, but I can't get it to start
We're machines that breathe and weep and look really good

Carved out of stone
Earth, blood, and bone
They knock the mountains down
The earth's grating sounds
They soothe the great machines
That yearn desperately
Just to lay them down
Within her gaping mouth

More than a symbol
More than I bargained for
More than a symbol
More than I bargained for

They wander ridges high
Between the earth and sky
Like spikes upon a crown
We wear upon our brow
And want is not a need
Reserved for human beings
Its fingers on your throat
Is pain that all things know

An army of the golems is stalking, now, the heart's lands
Eating all reality
Producing only dust and sand
Nothing hurts them
Nothing gets under their stone skin
And when their earthen mouths will open up
And just what words will come out but

Sleeping in and out
Of an ice bath
No warmth, no life without
It's too much
My arms, my legs are wood
Unconscious trees
With roots deep in the ground
We'll all be out
An ocean ringed with tile
I know that's not your style

I Don’t Love Lyrics
One of Deathconsciousness' more on-the-nose tracks, speaking quite literally about the want for death. It is a lack of love, for life or for something else, which drives this desire to not exist.

I don't want to live like this, Lord
I don't want to live at all
I don't want to make this face anymore
But if I don't, that's all

I don't want to live like this anymore
I don't want to live at all
I don't want to make this face anymore
But if I don't, that's all

I don't love
I don't feel anything
I don't feel anything where this love should be

I don't want to feel this anymore
But if I don't, that's fake
I don't want to do this anymore
But there's nothing else to take

I don't love

Hunter,
 
I'm laid out on the forest floor
Arrows in my back and sides
Down among the leaves and stones
You can wear my skin as armor
You can eat my flesh and bones
Leave nothing that is needed
All I have is yours

And I'll give myself up to your sharpened edges
I no longer cling to my life
Yes, I'm finally giving in

Teeth and hate end our relationship
Of course it's sad, but that's the way it is
Your violence always wins the day
Yes, your violence wins

And I'll give myself up to your sharpened edges
I no longer cling to my life
Yes, I'm finally giving in


Oh, and you watch as the animals
Lay themselves
Down at your feet
A thousand bared teeth
A thousand bowed heads
Yes, they're begging you for death


The Hunter does us all a great service
And we've done so much to deserve it

These atoms are liars
They do not realize, and we can't blame them
Art as a means of escape
They don't see the down-side
And that's what takes them
Out on the floor
One stretches out its hands
Into the small of a back
And as they circle the room, and as they circle the room
Room, room, room
And as they circle the floor, one just wants it more
Well, they don't want, anymore

You can sleep in these hollows and rivers
Exalt the righteous and drown the sinners

Why is love so lonely?

All water on earth
Evaporates into steam
And erupts from the ground
Does anyone else feel guilty?

To the explosive power of this bomb
How do we reconcile our deaths?
We'd better figure it out before long

It's time that all these things that I do, no matter what
Become things of the past

Of things I regret
But there aren't enough archangels in the sky to come down (and)
To make me feel right
I'm miserable whenever I think of it
And I think of it all the time
You could part their feathered wings and have your way with them
Just like you do to all of us, all the time
What point is there in pushing on
When all you push against is a brick wall?

Everyone spends some time on the cross
I just want to make sure it's not a total loss

Waiting for Black Metal Records to Come in the Mail Lyrics


What has become of all of us, all ceilings, all skies
Is that, the stars can swim a thousand dark miles
Before they ever see the floor again

With their backs against the wall on these last days
But then, we knew that would happen anyway

You drop that pitch-black pall
Over us, one and all, again
To propel your national machines
Giving us all the disease, but not the vaccine

A thousand tiny lives
Disappear into the black stretch
And I guess I thought I'd feel something but I didn't
But I didn't, yes, that's a myth

With their backs against the wall on these last days
But then, we knew that would happen anyway


You drop that pitch-black pall
Over us, one and all, again
To propel your national machines
Giving us all the disease, but not the vaccine

I would give anything for a cool glass of water
Without this poisonous oil

No, it's never gonna be good enough
No, it's never gonna be good enough

Telephony Lyrics
The narrator builds a telephone time machine or regular time machine to contact a deceased loved one. This song is rather heartbreaking considering the personal life of HANL band member Dan Barret.

If science is half the man it says it is
Then I can build it
The machine that snaps
All of time in half
I can break its back
I can break its back
I can build a door
And I can travel through
They do it with telephony
You don't see it much anymore, but
But surely I
But surely I

If I could just hear your voice
If I could just hear your voice
But I don't think I have the choice

The look on your face
When I first connect the line
For the very first time
My words come slowly to mind
""Is anybody there?""
All trembling and scared
Replies then come
Fainter than air

Burial Society Lyrics
Perhaps Have a Nice Life’s most graphic song, Burial Society describes the thought process and eventual actual death of a suicidal person.

I close my eyes a better man
Or imagine that I can imagine such a thing
And it goes on and on and on and on like that
Project myself into the air, and float in a weightless night
It’s better than sitting heavy backed
And sending waves of anxious hate into the street
Trying to shut down the stop lights
It isn't real, but it feels real
It isn't real, but it feels real

As I crane my neck to an emptiness
(Better than knowing nothing at all)
I feel in my chest 
(I know I know myself)
Cut my wrists, slit my throat
Take this body and string it up
'Cause I’ll never know

“I’m weak again, stay inside, hate everything”
Well hey, that’s our lot, and I’m already inside out
Cut my wrists, slit my throat, take this body and string it up
And I’ll never know what you said
Because I’ll be fucking dead by then

“I’m weak again, stay inside, hate everything”

Dr. Michael Wilkins
 & *Dr. Richard Koch*]
You have just heard about Johnny
He's been causing discipline problems here at Pennhurst
So they thought they would send him to Q2
We thought you would like to see where Johnny lives
Johnny, can you talk?
Yes
Do you like it here at Pennhurst?
No
Why not, John?
Um
It's—, it's bad
Let me ask you this, John, do you remember living anywhere except Pennhurst?
No
Do you like talking to the people up here?
Yeah
Why, John?
'Cause they like to talk to me
How about the other kids, the ones that can talk, do they like to talk to you too?
Yes
Do you like to talk to them better than the kids up here?
Yes
Have you been talking more lately or less?
Less
Why are you here in Q2, John?
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
So they punished you and put you here?
Yes
And they do this to you all the time, John?
Yes
Why are you here in Q2, John?
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
Why are you here in Q2, John?
The doctor had warned me that it would be bad, it was horrible
 (
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)
There was one attendant for perhaps fifty severely and profoundly retarded children
 (
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing, I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)
The ones that we saw were the most, uh, severely and profoundly retarded
 (
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing, I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)
There are thousands here like them, uh, not going to school, sitting on the ward all day
 (
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing, I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)
Not being talked to by anyone
 (
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)
Only one or two or three people to take care of seventy people on the ward
 (
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)
Sharing the same toilets, contracting the same diseases
 (
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)
Can the children be trained?
 (
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)
Yes, every child can be trained, you know, these kids, there's no effort, we don't know what these kids are capable of doing
 (
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing, I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)
(
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)
*And I think your priorities are mixed up in New York, in terms of serving the retarded*
 (
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)
*Your top investment is in institutions*
 (
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)
*Our top investment is in the Department of Education*
 (
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)
*In providing a program for the child while he's at home in terms of day care*
 (
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing, I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)
*For example, these kids can go to school at age three years*
 (
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)
*So they start at very young, and that helps a great deal for the parents*
 (
I did something I wasn't supposed to be doing
)

[Verse 1: Dan Barrett, 
Dr. Richard Koch
]
A sign (
And when the parents are actively—
)
That I've been praying for
A solemn augur, pure and true
To tell me what to do
Untrue
God that I can settle for
And spin my body in a long, slow arc
Like how my problems are

And I've been waiting on everyone
And I've been waiting on
'Cause I've been waiting on anyone
To show up and throw me out of here
Yeah, I've been waiting on anyone (Because I don't belong)
And I'm not even sure I know those words
'Cause I've been waiting on anyone
And I've been waiting on
'Cause I've been waiting on

A song
That I can sing along
Well, I'll just wait and track the soot-tracks home
And I can be alone


'Cause I've been waiting on everyone
I've been waiting on
'Cause I've been waiting on anyone
To show up and throw me out of here
'Cause I've been waiting on everyone
I've been waiting on
And I've been waiting on anyone
[Outro: Dan Barrett,

]
To show up and throw me out of here
To show up and throw me out of here
To show up and throw me out of here
To show up and throw me out of here
To show up and throw me out of here

A remake of the original version from 2010’s “Voids” cassette. Previously stringy and pale, the song is now brawny and dark.  The bass line, once a bubbling throwback to Joy Division’s “Walked in Line”, has…

아름다운 세상 (Beautiful World) Lyrics


뭐 듣고 있는 거야?
Lily Chou-Chou

만약 이 세상이 전부 누군가의 또 다른 꿈이었다면
언젠가 깨어나게 될 때 나는 지금과는 달라져 있을까
자신의 망상에 갇힌 채 현실을 제대로 바라보지 못하는
한심한 꼴로 돌아다녀 또다시 두 눈과 두 귀를 막아버려

""언젠가는 잘될 거야 언젠가는 빛날 거야""

세상살이와 멀어져가는 내 자신이 너무나 역겨워
다가올 미래가 두려워 또다시 똑같은 실수를 반복해

""언젠가는 잘될 거야 언젠가는 빛날 거야""
(네가 날 지켜줘)

(아 아 아 아)


나의 비참한 모습을 아무도 보지 않았으면
나의 수많은 실패를 누구도 보지 않았으면 (아)
나의 어리고 멍청했던 날들은 사라져줬으면
나의 소중한 인연들 이제는 추억 속으로만
(""언젠가는 잘될 거야 언젠가는 빛날 거야"")
만약 이 세상이 전부 누군가의 또 다른 꿈이었다면 (""언젠가는 잘될 거야"")

Lily Chou-Chou If this whole world was just someone else's dream When I wake up someday, will I be different from now? Trapped in one's own delusions and unable to look at reality properly I walk around looking pathetic and block my eyes and ears again “Someday it will work out, someday it will shine.” I'm so disgusted with myself for moving away from the world. I'm afraid of the future and repeat the same mistake again “Someday it will work out, someday it will shine.” (You protect me) (ah ah ah ah) I hope no one sees my miserable appearance I hope no one sees my many failures (ah) I wish my young and foolish days would disappear My precious relationships are now just memories (“Someday it will work out, someday it will shine”) If this whole world was just someone else's dream (""It'll all work out someday"") When I wake up someday, will I be different than I am now (“Someday I will shine”)"

흰천장 (White Ceiling) Lyrics
늦은 밤에 일어나면 제일 먼저 눈에 띄는
흰 천장과 그다음엔 혐오스런 나의 몸
이제는 내 방 온도에 익숙해진지도 오래
어둠 속 뿐만이 나의 마음의 안식처
어제는 오늘 같고 오늘은 내일 같고
내일은 어제 같고 달라진게 없잖아
일요일 아침에도 월요일 아침에도
금요일 저녁에도 달라진게 없잖아
말라버린 도시 풍경 뒤틀어진 나의 성격
잊어버린 과거 모습 왜곡되는 나의 기억
시끄러운 주변 잡음 짙어지는 나의 불안
잊어버린 어른 모습 무뎌지는 나의 감각
어제는 오늘 같고 오늘은 내일 같고
내일은 어제 같고 달라진게 없잖아
일요일 아침에도 월요일 아침에도
금요일 저녁에도 달라진게 없잖아
혼자서 지내는 겨울밤은 아름다웠고
어느 무엇으로도 표현할 수가 없어서
그대로 시간이 영원히 멈추길 바라네
이대로 아무런 생각도 하지 않은채로

지금 이 순간이 영원했으면 좋겠어
귀찮은 것들은 전부 밖으로 던져버려
저 밖의 세상은 나와는 전혀 다른 세상
이불속에 처박혀 그대로 도망가
아무것도 못 본 채 그저 도망가고
변명하지도 못한 채 그저 피해대고
아무도 믿지 못한 채 담을 쌓고
기다릴 때마다 매일이 지나가고
무언갈 미워한 채 무언가를 갈망하고
땀도 흘리지 않은 채 어리광을 부리고
시간만 원망한 채 아무것도 하지않고
언제나 언제나 언제나
오늘도 일어나면 눈앞에는 흰 천장
어제도 일어나면 눈앞에는 흰 천장
내일도 일어나면 눈앞에는 흰 천장

Only in the dark is my heart a haven Yesterday is like today, today is like tomorrow Tomorrow is like yesterday, nothing has changed On Sunday morning and on Monday morning Nothing changed on Friday evening The dried up cityscape and my distorted personality My forgotten past and my distorted memories Noisy surrounding noise intensifies my anxiety I have forgotten the adult image and my senses are becoming dull. Yesterday is like today, today is like tomorrow Tomorrow is like yesterday, nothing has changed On Sunday morning and on Monday morning Nothing changed on Friday evening The winter night spent alone was beautiful I can't express it with anything I wish time would stop forever Just like this, without even thinking about it. I wish this moment would last forever Throw out all the annoying things The world out there is completely different from mine. Get wrapped up in the blanket and run away. Without seeing anything, I just ran away. Without being able to make excuses, I just avoid it. Building a wall without trusting anyone Every day passes as I wait Hating something and longing for something Acting foolishly without even breaking a sweat Just blaming the time and doing nothing always always always When I wake up again today, the white ceiling in front of my eyes Yesterday, when I woke up, the white ceiling was in front of my eyes.

Parannoul - Excuse (English Translation) Lyrics
At the crossroad where there's no future at all
Someone will take the lead with courage
""Effort is overrated. If there's no result, it's gone.""
As I watch the people around me growing up
My little inferiority grows bigger and bigger
""Effort is overrated. If there's no result, it's gone.""
My goals are becoming more and more clear
But my purposes are becoming more and more mеaningless
Just like the othеrs
I was just a child to say I was all grown up

더는 힘낼 필요 없을까

파란노을 아래에서

자유롭고 싶었어 언제나

새로운 무언가가 기다려

Parannoul - Youth Rebellion (English Translation) Lyrics
Every day is the same
Every day is boring as fuck
What am I living for
I've forgotten that already
There's no such youth as I've seen in cartoons
Every day is the same
Every day I endure
I gave up tomorrow
I wonder if it's better than today
There's no such youth as I've seen in cartoons
Only invisible despair and hopelessness here
Will you be defeated like this, and get stuck in the corner of the room, and let it go helpless?
Losеr jobless virgin jackass fucking dickhead
Antisocial hikikomori
I was more dеsperate than anyone else
I wanted to be on stage
I wanted to be a rockstar
There's no such youth as I've seen in cartoons
Only a invisible despair and hopelessness here
In the corner of the room, defeated like this, now I start a helpless rebellion
Loser jobless virgin jackass fucking dickhead
Antisocial hikikomori
I want to be famous
I want to be on stage
I want to be a rockstar

Loser jobless virgin jackass fucking dickhead
Antisocial hikikomori
I was more desperate than anyone else
I wanted to be on stage
I wanted to be a rockstar
20 years old youth rebellion that will never come again
20 years old youth rebellion that will never be forgotten
I know I won't, I know I can't, but I still want to struggle
No matter what anyone says, my story won't die
No matter what anyone says, my song won't die
The sun will rise again tomorrow
We will live like that anyway

격변의 시대 (Age of Fluctuation) Lyrics
무엇이 진실되고 무엇이 거짓된지
현실과 가상의 잔상만 가득한
격변의 시대에 반기를 띄우는
동료들은 하나둘씩 사라지고
나 홀로 이곳에 서있네
아무것도 바라지 않은채로
모두가 바뀌어갈때 영원할 나의 영토여
세상이 나를 등지더라도 나만은 나를 지켜주기를
무엇이 그대이고 무엇이 나인지
현실과 가상의 중간에 서있네
서로의 제국은 점점 문을 활짝 열어두고
눈 둘 줄 모르는 백성들 누구에게 화풀이하는가
이젠 지쳤어 이젠 질렸어 아침이 온다 내일이 온다
나 홀로 이곳에 누우네 더는 서있을 힘도 없이
모두가 바뀌어갈때 너무나 늦은 나의 시대
세상이 나를 등지더라도 나만은 나를 지켜주기를
세상이 나를 등지더라도 나만은 나를 지켜주기를

거짓된 추억에 잠겨버린 격변의 시대의 부적응자

청춘반란 (Youth Rebellion) Lyrics
매일매일이 똑같아 하루하루가 지겨워
뭘 위해 살아가는지 그딴건 잊어버린지 오래
만화에서나 보던 그런 청춘은 없어
매일매일이 똑같아 하루하루를 견뎌내
내일은 버린지 오래 오늘보다는 나을지 궁금해
만화에서나 보던 그런 청춘은 없어
눈에 보이지 않는 허무함 뿐 절망감 뿐
이대로 패배한채 방구석에 처박혀 무기력하게 보낼건가

이대로 패배한채 방구석에 처박혀 치르는 무기력한 반란

누구보다 간절했었어 무대에도 서고싶었어 락스타가 되고싶었어

다신 오지않을 스무살의 청춘반란
평생 잊지못할 스무살의 청춘반란
못할걸 잘 알면서도 안될걸 잘 알면서도 그래도 발버둥치고 싶어
누가 뭐라해도 내 이야긴 죽지않아
누가 뭐라해도 내 노래는 죽지않아

북극성 (Polaris) Lyrics


새벽에 눈이 떠지면
창문을 제일 먼저 바라봐
모두가 잠든 시간에도
북극성은 멀리 서있어

모두가 듣네
나만의 대화

상상력을 키워봐
불가능이라는 건 없어
내일 밤이 되면 나는
북극성에서 널 바라볼 거야

소원을 빌고 받아들여
비웃음은 나의 원동력
부정할 수가 없었는걸
나의 꿈 나의 몸 나의 삶



반짝이다 떨어져라
불타올라 더 크고 밝게
어른이 되면 달이 될거야
너무 밝지도 어둡지도 않아
(모두가 듣네)
나는 마법에 걸린 채
꿈을 걸어가네

앞으로 나아가

Parannoul - Age of Fluctuation (English Translation) Lyrics
What's true and what's false
Only afterimages of reality and imaginary
Revolting against the age of fluctuation
My friends disappear one by one
Now I stand here alone
Without wanting anything
While everything changes
My territory will last forever
Even if the world turns away from me
I wish myself to protect me
What's you and what's me
Standing in the middle of reality and imaginary
The empires of each other keep their doors wide open
People who don't know where to look, who do they vent their anger on?
I'm tired of it
I'm sick of it
Morning is coming
Tomorrow is coming
Now I lie here alone
Having no power to stand
Everyone changes
But my days are too late

Even if the world turns away from me
I want me to protect myself
A misfit in an age of fluctuation
Locked in its false memories
Now I sleep here alone
To see the next part of the dream
Everyone changes
But my days are too late

Dreams Tonite Lyrics
“Dreams Tonite” seems to be about having so much love and caring for someone, but the relationship you had has fallen apart. This is quite obvious by the pre-chorus' lines “who starts a fire just to let it go…

Rode here on the bus
Now you're one of us
It was magic hour
Counting motorbikes
On the turnpike
One of Eisenhower's

Live your life on a merry-go-round
Who starts a fire just to let it go out?

If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight?
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?

On a weird guitar
Said you wrote a while
In the waking hour
In fluorescent light
Antisocialites
Watch a wilting flower


Live your life on a merry-go-round
Who builds a wall just to let it fall down?

If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight?
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
Don't let motion distort everything
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
Don't let motion distort everything

Don't sit by the phone for me
Wait at home for me, all alone for me
Your face was supposed to be hanging over me like a rosary
So morose for me, seeing ghosts of me
Writing oaths to me, is it so naïve to wonder?

If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
Don't let motion distort everything
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
Don't let motion distort everything

Archie, Marry Me Lyrics

You've expressed explicitly your contempt for matrimony
You've student loans to pay and will not risk the alimony
We spend our days locked in a room, content inside a bubble
And in the nighttime, we go out and scour the streets for trouble

Hey, hey
Marry me, Archie
Hey, hey
Marry me, Archie

During the summer, take me sailing out on the Atlantic
I won't set my sights on other seas, there is no need to panic
So honey, take me by the hand and we can sign some papers
Forget the invitations, floral arrangements and bread makers

Hey, hey
Marry me, Archie
Hey, hey
Marry me, Archie

Too late to go out
Too young to stay in
They're talking about
Us living in sin

Adult Diversion Lyrics

How do I get close to you?
Even if you don't notice
As I admire you on the subway
When it's dark outside your house
You won't let anybody out
And keep a padlock on your door, well

One more cocktail
And I'm on your trail

If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And sit inside so very quietly

How do I grow old with you?
Even if you don't notice
As I pass by you on the sidewalk
When it's dark outside your house
You won't let anybody out
You're keeping a dead girl in the closet


One more cocktail
Is it a good time?
Or is it highly inappropriate?

If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And then go back to university
If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And sit inside so very quietly

I won't waste a (Moment)
I won't waste a—

In Undertow Lyrics

You find a wave and try to hold on for as long as you can
You made a mistake you'd like to erase and I understand
""What's left for you and me?""
I ask that question rhetorically
Can't buy into astrology
And won't rely on the moon for anything

No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back after what's been said
No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back

Meditate, play solitaire, take up self-defense
When you get old and faded out, will you want your friends?
What's left for you and me?
You respond to my question metaphorically
Don't read into psychology
And won't rely on your mood for anything

No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back after what was said
No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back after what's been said


You find a wave and try to hold on for as long as you can
You made a mistake you'd like to erase and I understand
What's next for you and me?
I'll take suggestions, we toss and turn
In undertow
Time to let go, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

There's no turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back after what's transpired
No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back, it's so uninspired

Not My Baby Lyrics

Now that you’re not my baby, I'll go do whatever I want
No need to turn around to see what’s behind me, I don’t care
And it’s true, I’ve been checking out lately, I go do whatever I want
No need to turn around to see what’s behind me, I don’t care

Because I’m really not there
I’m really not there

And now that you’re not my baby
I’ll go do whatever I want
No need to sit at home with the dial tone
'Cause I don’t care
And it’s true, I’ve been going out lately
And I go do whatever I want
You can write it down with a fountain pen
Close your eyes and then count to ten
You can tell your friends that I don’t make sense
And I don’t care

Because I’m really not there
I'm really not there


The night is like a fading radio
The lake was frozen over long ago

Now that you’re not my baby
(Now you’re not)
Now that you’re not my baby
(Now you’re not)

You sought an eye
So did I for an island
You sought an eye
So did I for an eye
Traded my rose-coloured shades for a wide lens
Used to make noise, now, I much prefer silence

Now that you’re not my baby
(Now you’re not)
Now that you’re not my baby
(Now you’re not)
Now that you’re not my baby
(Now you’re not)
Now that you’re not my baby
(Now you’re not)

Walking through the trees
I never really know what's on your mind
Is it ever me or just someone you've left behind?
Floating through a dream
I never could make out the words you said
Sentences are bouncing back and forth inside my head

You don't have to leave
You could just stay here with me
Forget all the party police
We can find comfort in debauchery

Fighting through the fog
I can't believe it rained all summer long
When every day's a hurricane, you know there's something wrong
I see you every day

I cannot decipher conversation in your head

Next of Kin Lyrics

We walked along the rocks for nearly an hour
I caught the way you looked at me in the sunlight
You took something before you went in the shower
To help suppress the things that make you feel uptight

If I'd known you couldn't swim
We would never have gone in

I left my love in the river
The only one who sees
I lost his hand in the current
It was the life I wanted and I hoped for
And now I am left sifting through the weeds

The sun so hot, I saw his skin through his T-shirt
The grass so tall, we knew we wouldn't be found
We climbed into the stream sure no one would be hurt
And in no time at all, there wasn't a sound

If I'd known you couldn't swim
We would never have gone in


I left my love in the river
The only one who sees
I lost his hand in the current
It was the life I wanted and I hoped for
And now I am left sifting through the weeds

No colour to his skin
Inform the next of kin
No colour to his skin

I left my love in the river
The only one I see
I lost his hand in the current
And now I am left looking through the trees

Atop a Cake Lyrics
Similar to “Archie, Marry Me”, this track explores marriage and the expectations of matrimony.

I lie on a sofa awake
It's what you said last night
You'd like us on top of a cake
But you won't let me take a bite

Flowers arriving in fleets
Can't we talk about this?
Why let the state in our sheets?
Can't we do without it?

Well, I don't mean to wind you up
But I'd like to slow it down
How do I remain a pup
If you put me in a gown?

What's it got to do with you?
What's it got to do with me?
How could I lose control
When you're driving from the back seat?
What's it got to do with you?
What's it got to do with me?
How could I lose control
When you're driving from the back seat?


Corners begin to repeat
I think we're getting lost
We walked to the end of the street
But we were bitten by the frost

So if you have to thaw me out
You can put me in a pail
Can we take another route?
I don't want to wear a veil

What's it got to do with you?
What's it got to do with me?
How could I lose control
When you're driving from the back seat?
What's it got to do with you?
What's it got to do with me?
How could I lose control
When you're driving from the back seat?

I'll wait in the lobby for someone to show
And if they don't come, I will know where to go
The bodies are lined up outside in the hall
I don't want to decay in a mall


If everything you say is true
Then why would I disagree?
How could I lose control?

What's it gotta do with you?

You'd like us on top of a cake
But you won't let me take a bite

Can't we talk about this?

Can't we do without it?

When I chip through your candy coating
You're stuffed with insulation
Just strawberry ice cream floating
With a sprinkle of indignation
Cherry under knot of shoestring
Conflate and agitate

And you're gettin' me down, gettin' me down, gettin' me down
Gettin' me down down down, you're gettin' me down
Gettin' me down, gettin' me down, gettin' me down
Plimsoll punk

Your posture's blocking out any possible light
I can hardly see
This conversation spirals into a fight
I can barely breathe

Who ran from 
Roman candles
Underneath a willow weeping?
Do the tealights on your mantel
Illuminate 
that summer feeling?
You're the seashell in my sandal
That's slicing up my heel


You're a

And you're getting me down, gettin' me down, gettin' me down
Gettin' me down down, down you're gettin' me down

Can't explain my ankle sprain

New dress could turn your head
But how long 'til we reel it in?

Paradise and I find myself paralyzed
Knowing all too well

Blue Rev behind the rink
I didn't really need it
Circumspect when you call collect
To see if I would keep it

Paradise and I find myself paralyzed
Knowing all too well terrified
But I'll find my way

Moving to the country
Gonna have that baby
Wait tables in town
I know word gets around
Moving to the country
Gonna have this baby
See how it goes
See how it grows


And I find myself paralyzed
Knowing all too well terrified

Saw Jim Reid in the corridor
And I wondered if he could ever see me that way
He was on my list at the grocery store
When you grabbed my wrist and said you liked my keychain
Read your feature in the weekly paper
And honestly, I found it a little bit bloated
Friday, we fell through the coffee table
And that’s when I discovered that my heart exploded

How?
How?

You're a lollipop
In the form of a lightning bolt
You're a lollipop in my hair
But I'm a gumdrop
Am I ever gonna fit that mould?
'Cause I don't have the patience to wait in line for you

When I came back to apologize
You asked me if I was intrigued by LSD
I sat next to you on the picnic bench
And before I knew it, you were flying next to me
I met your baby at the exposition
And frankly, I found it a little unnerving
I let you know when we were driving home
And all I can remember is the fact that we're swerving


You're a lollipop
In the form of a lightning bolt
You're a lollipop in my hair
(
How could I ever obtain you?
)
But you're a doorstop
When you're lying on the bathroom floor
And I don't have the time to wait in line for you
(
How could I ever betray you?
)

Alter my state to get through this date
(
You're alone in this picture
And it swallows me whole
)
Alter my state to get through this date
(
You're alone in this picture
And it swallows me whole
)
Alter my state to get through this date
(
You're alone in this picture
)
Alter my state to get through this date
(
And it swallows me whole
You're alone in this picture

Alter my state to get through this date

You're a lollipop
(
How could I ever obtain you?
)
In the form of a lightning bolt
You're a lollipop in my hair
(
How could I ever betray you?
)
You look like Iggy Pop
Circa '73 or '4
(
How could I ever obtain you?
)
Because I don't have the time wait in line for you

Saved by a Waif Lyrics

New Saturday
In the park, didn’t think you fell that hard
Woke up again
Woke up and you wanted a new start
New Saturday
In the park, didn’t think you fell that hard
Oh, Adrian
The silver maple never saw you coming

Stay where you are
State what you are
Stay where you are
And no one gets hurt

You cut your hair
Now you look like a little boy
You climbed the stairs
So high, you can’t come down from there
Said you wanted to get it together but you don’t
Said you wanted to get it together but you won’t

Say something, waste something
Change your life
Take something, break something
Make your flight
Say something, anything
Mommy wants you to be a doctor
So she can tell her friends you’re like your father
And if it’s all for the sake of conversation
Then maybe you should try a new vocation
Oh, saved by a waif and the weight of your wayfarers

Not to 
be confused with
 hippies in Toronto

You cut your hair
Now you look like a little boy
You climbed the stairs
So high, you can’t come down from there
Said you wanted to get it together but you don’t
Said you wanted to get it together but you won’t

Easy On Your Own? Lyrics

I dropped out
College education's 
a dull knife
If you don't believe in the lettered life
Then maybe this is our only try
And how I gauge
Whether this is stasis or change
Fill out the requirements on the page
And burn out before you can get paid

'Cause we're always
Crawling in monochromatic hallways
Dream we pull a one-eighty some day

If you don't like it, well
Say it's over, well
Weekends alone

Evеr lay back and watch the sunrise?
Ever hеar violins in your mind?
You know it's only wind outside

'Cause we're always
Crawling in monochromatic hallways
Dream about burning down all day


If you don't like it, well (You don't like it)
Say it's over, well (Say it's over)
Weekends alone
Does it get easier on your own?
Does it get easier on your own?

I waited so long for you
Wasted some of the best years of my life
And I wanted to see it through
This time
This time

You don't like it

Forget About Life Lyrics

I thought of going in the lake and swallowing
Thought that I had unplugged the phone until it rang
When the phases of the moon, they don’t apply
When accomplishing a simple task takes several tries

Did you want to forget about life?
Did you want to forget about life with me tonight?
Underneath this flickering light
Did you want to forget about life with me tonight?

Left the apartment in a state of disarray
Tried out the synthesizer you bought yesterday
When the failures of the past, they multiply
And you trivialize the things that keep your hand from mine

Did you want to forget about life?
Did you want to forget about life with me tonight?
Under condominium signs
Did you want to forget about life with me tonight? Woo!



Do you want to forget about life?
Do you want to forget about life with me tonight?

Do you want to forget about life with me tonight?

Drifting in and out, you see the road you're on
It came rollin' down your cheek

And in-between,

If you built yourself a myth, you'd know just what to give
What comes after this momentary bliss?
The consequence of what you do to me

Help me to name it

Found yourself in a new direction
Arrows fallin' from the sun
Canyon callin',

Let you know you're not the only one

PPP Lyrics
The song could be about a couple getting married, and one of them is having doubts about whether or not they were ready for the plunge.

Out in the heartland
I looked in your eyes
And I asked, ""Are you ready
Ready for this life?""

Did you see it coming?
It happened so fast
The timing was perfect
Water on glass

Like tracing figure eights
On ice in skates, oh well
And if this ice should break
It would be my
My mistake

Between the cities
Between the thrills
There's something inside you
That doesn't sleep well

It won't last forever
Or maybe it will
The white clothes they gave you
You wear them so well


Someone once told me
In love, that you must
Place all you're given
In infinite trust

Yet I'm tracing figure eights
On ice in skates, so well
And if this ice should break
It would be my
My mistake",https://genius.com/Beach-house-ppp-lyrics,"Svenska

Wildflower Lyrics
In this song Victoria imagines herself as the Wildflower – something unintentional and organic.

No better colour
Looked everywhere
Driving home every night
The shadows stay by your side

You built a city
All in your head
Triangle of ever light
It turns you on every night


Need a companion
A hidden prayer
You know you're not losing your mind
What's left, you make something of it

The sky and what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
Baby, I'm yours



No better colour
Looked everywhere
You built a city
All in your head
You know you're not losing your mind
What’s left, you make something of it

The sky and what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it

You and me with our long hair on the gold wall
After midnight we could feel it all
I'd go anywhere you want me to

On the bridge, levitating 'cause we want to
When the unknown will surround you
(When the unknown will surround you) There is no right time, there is no right time

The branches of the trees, they will hang lower now
You will grow too quick, then you will get over it

Stand beside it, we can't hide the way you make us glow

Sparks Lyrics

We drive around this town
Houses melting down
A vision turning green
Is all we've ever seen
And then it's dark again

A new development
Wishing that it meant
Something natural
Don't we know it's cruel

And it goes dark again
Just like a spark

Hallucination comes
Think of everyone
That never shared before
From my mouth to yours

And then it's dark again
Just like a spark
And then it vanishes
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark
And then we're vanishing
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark


You go to school, you follow all the rules, you live inside
Realize there's something in your eyes, you're back again
From the spine rising through the mind, you give it up
(Just like a spark) It's a gift taken from the lips, you live again

Make it
Wave it
Alive
Make it

And then it vanishes
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark
And then we're vanishing
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark
(Just like a spark) It's a gift taken from the lips, you live again
Make it
Wave it
Alive
Make it
Wave it
Alive","Svenska We drive around this town Houses melting down A vision turning green Is all we've ever seen And then it's dark again A new development Wishing that it meant Something natural Don't we know it's cruel And it goes dark again Just like a spark Hallucination comes Think of everyone From my mouth to yours And then it's dark again Just like a spark And then it vanishes No one around And then it comes again Just like a spark And then we're vanishing No one around And then it comes again Just like a spark (Just like a spark) It's a gift taken from the lips, you live again Make it Wave it Alive Make it Wave it Alive"

Read my fortune too
Tell me what you see
Cross it like a T
It's all the same to me
This game I play
I do it every day
Then promise I'll be fine
Bear it every time

When you turn the lights down low
Lemon color, honey glow

See this state I'm in
Is crawling in my skin
Fevers took me back
And turned me inside out

When you turn the lights down low
Lemon color, honey glow

It's what you do
This pulls me through
To the other end
Where it begins
You see through me
Still, it's coming back
I come alive
You stay all night


You feel it coming right through you
The color of your mind
The color of your mind
The color of your mind
You feel it coming right through you (You feel it coming right through you)
It's on the other side
It doesn't have to be this way (Doesn't have to be this way)

Have You Passed Through This Night? Lyrics

This great evil
Where's it come from?
How'd it steal into the world?
What seed, what root did it grow from?
Who's doing this?
Who's killing us?
Robbing us of life and light
Mocking us with the sight of what we might've known?
Does our ruin benefit the earth?
Does it help the grass to grow or the sun to shine?
Is this darkness in you, too?

Lone Survivor (Script) Lyrics
FINAL
LONE SURVIVOR
Written by Peter Berg
Based on the book by Marcus Luttrell
""NEVER OUT OF THE FIGHT""
-Navy SEAL Creed
1 EXT. BAGRAM AIR BASE, AFGHANISTAN 1 Through massive sun flare, a BLACKHAWK Chopper coming in
fast. Landing hard on Bagram Air Base.
LUTTRELL (vo)
It’s something most of us have known all of our lives. What we all wanted. It’s in our blood.
A team of medical personal and Navy officers descend on the chopper. An assortment of high-ranking GENERALS and COMMANDING OFFICERS there to meet the chopper. Tight shots. A bloody hand dangles. A tear filled eyeball, sliced feet.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) (vo)
There’s a storm inside of us. I’ve heard many team guys speak of this. A burning. A river. A drive.
2 INT. OPERATING ROOM 2
Clothes cut. Blood soaked Dog Tags cut. “Luttrell” in UA boxer shorts, IVs and fresh blood bags. Multiple Gunshots. Chunk of an ear missing. Heartbeat monitor. Weak pulse.
LUTTRELL (vo)
An unrelenting desire to push yourself harder and further than anyone could think possible.
Chunks of bullet and shrapnel filling metal bowl. Tears streaming down cheeks, a hand scrawled map on a left thigh, focused eyes of surgeons. Admirals’ pace in the hallway.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) (vo)
Pushing ourselves into those dark cold corners where the bad things live. Where the bad things fight.
Heart monitor weak. Getting weaker. Compound fracture left shin. Bloody feet rinsed clean. Water flushing out bullet holes. Loose cracked tooth pulled out. Heart monitor getting weaker.
Surgical pack working franticly to save Luttrell. Tight on HEART MONITOR: FLATLINE
LUTTRELL CONT’D
We wanted that fight at the highest
volume. The loud fight. The loudest, coldest, hottest, most unpleasant of the unpleasant fights.
Pushing in on the flatline. Alarm screaming. Tight on Luttrell’s eyes starting to glaze over. Dying.
BLACK.
GRAPHIC:
“FIVE DAYS EARLIER”
3 EXT. HIGH ABOVE NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN - HINDU KUSH 3 SUNSET.
Rugged and punishing. Endless and infinite. Steep stone mountains. Bottomless valleys. Cold and dry.
As we fly across this stunning land, from the bottom of the FRAME, ENTER:
A SPECIAL FORCE AIR INSERT TEAM.
FOUR HELICOPTERS. Two MH-47s transport. Two security Apaches.
3A IN THE CHOPPER: 3A
TIGHT ON MARCUS LUTTRELL. Healthy and very clear eyed.
12 SEALs fully dressed for combat. Sitting side by side. Clearly ready for war.
3B INT. MH-47 INSERT CHOPPER 3B Seen from above. Cruising at 150 over the shoulder of a .50-

Airmen, and 12 SEALs.
5 EXT. HINDU KUSH - DUSK 5 The Choppers tearing across the Afghan mountains.

6 INT. THE CHOPPER - DUSK
Luttrell checks his map against his wrist strapped GPS.
Whistles quietly to himself.
LUTTRELL
I don’t see anything but steep. I
could be wrong. Hope I’m wrong. If it’s anything but steep I’m not seeing it.
DIETZ
Just put your feet where I put my
feet. All day long. You’re gonna love it.

SHANE PATTON plugged into an iPod. SLIPKNOT pounding into his head. He quietly sings along.
Kristensen leans over to Axelson, the navigator, adjusts his upper right strap on his front pack.
KRISTENSEN
I’m real interested in the pitch.
If it ain’t fucking glorious, come back, try another route. Don’t waste your time trying to cross something that’s gonna knock the shit out of us.
AXE Roger that.
Kristensen moves over to MIKE MURPHY.
KRISTENSEN
She does not need a Arabic horse.
MURPHY
How do you know about that?
KRISTENSEN
I know everything Murphy.
MURPHY Check.
KRISTENSEN
Morab Tennessee Walking Horse cross
stallion.
What?
MURPHY
3.
KRISTENSEN
Original Silver. Lone Ranger’s
Horse.
MURPHY Really?
KRISTENSEN
Tennessee cross stallion. That’s a
fucking horse.
MURPHY Yes sir.
KRISTENSEN
Lone Ranger’s horse of choice.
MURPHY Sounds excellent sir.
KRISTENSEN Glorious horse Murphy.
Tight on Luttrell starring into the plunging sun.
7 EXT. AFGHAN VILLAGE - DAY 7 INTERCUT AFGHAN VILLAGE. Intro Afghan warlord. AHMAD SHAH.
35 years old. Tall, strong. Fierce. He moves through an Afghan village with a small pack of equally fierce Taliban warriors.
3A.
￼
LOCAL AFGHANS avoid eye contact. This Shah and crew feels like an old school western bad guy moving through a cow town.
NOTHING like the SUICIDE BOMBERS of BAGDAD. These are real warriors. Strong-jawed. Thin but ripped muscles. Worn rich soulful faces, vivid eyes, color reds and blues. Strong boots. Military vests. Good radio equipment. Well-maintained weapons.
Shah’s number two is TARAQ. Late twenties. Shah is vicious, TARAQ, is more vicious. Strong and very, very violent.
A very worthy opponent.
RIGHT now they are clearly pissed. Shah leads the way, walks with purpose.
They are looking for a man. Someone has violated TALIBAN LAW, accused of aiding the Americans.
Shah moves into a house. Women and children terrified. Trembling. Women pleading.
Where is he?
SHAH SHAH Hagha Cherta Dey?
The women scream. As Shah starts throwing teenage boys around the room. Slamming them viciously into walls.
A 25-year-old man Gulab tries to reason with Shah. A YOUNG BOY watches.
GULAB GULAB
Please, we want no trouble. Mehrabani/lutfan, monga hes
mushkil no ghowaro
Taraq throws Gulab down hard. Turns, locks eyes with an older Afghan man(30s). Taraq moves quickly at him, kicking him in the face, his foot down hard on his throat.
SHAH
Have you spoken with the
Americans?
AFGHAN MAN Please! No!
SHAH
Aya taso Americayano sara khaberi keri dey?
AFGHAN MAN
Mehrabani/lutfan! Na!
Gulab watches. Frustrated. Furious.
You lie! Please!
TARAQ
AFGHAN MAN
TARAQ
Ta Dorogh wayee!
AFGHAN MAN
Mehrabani/lutfan!
4.
He’s pressing down hard. Choking the man. The man’s family begs and screams. Shah studies the Afghan deep into his eyes. Decides he’s lying...Shah nods to Taraq.
Taraq yanks the Afghan to his feet. As his children watch Taraq leads the pleading farmer outside. Into the woods.
Taraq and his men throw the Afghan down over a fallen log. Face up.
Two of Taraq’s men hold him by the beard as Taraq stands over him. Razor sharp machete up.
Shah backlit. Ignoring the man’s pleading...as Taraq hacks down with brutal fury.
Tight on Shah, tight on Taraq, blood dripping from his hand. BLACK
GRAPHIC: BAGRAM AIR BASE - 14 HOURS EARLIER
CUT TO:
8 EXT. BAGRAM AIR BASE - DAWN 8 Sun just beginning to rise over the Base.
Beautiful.
Camera moves though the sleeping base. Guards man posts. Aircraft static on runways in Hangars’. Tent after tent soldiers’ sleep.
We come to a small base within a base. 10 foot rebar framed dirt walls. Barbed wire. Heavy Iron gate.
A fortress within a fortress.
Graphic.
8A SEAL TEAM 10 CAMP OUELLETTE, BAGRAM AIR BASE - SUNRISE 8A
We move inside the SEAL compound. Several plywood buildings. Assorted trucks, Jeeps, heavy ATVs.
9 INT. SEAL BUNK ROOMS 9
Marcus Luttrell sleeps. Peaceful. Tight shots. Luttrell’s room. A Texas flag. Family pictures. Mom, Dad, twin Brother Morgan. SEAL Trident. Wanted poster Osama bin Laden. Guns, knifes, grenades.
5.
DANNY DIETZ sleeps. His walls covered with his art. Demons and Dragons and Serpents. Beautiful and haunting. Pictures of his wife, Patsy. His dogs. His parents.
Matt Axelson sleeps. Curly red hair. Pictures of his family. American flag. Freddie Couples walking the bridge at St. Andrews. Map of Afghanistan.
MIKE MURPHY
Rooms a mess. Clothes and gear everywhere. Grenades on a desk next to a copy of GATES OF FIRE. New York Rangers flag next to a SEAL Flag, 8 x 10 head shot of Ron Burgundy.
Tight on Murphy. His eyes slowly open. Hold a moment. Murphy checks watch. 0500. Slow and smooth Murphy rises. Body strong. Not ripped. Effortless power.
Murphy goes to his computer. Opens it and checks his mail. Tight on Murphy’s inbox.
A picture of an Arabian Horse. Murphy studies the picture.
9A MOVING DOWN HALLWAY 9A Murphy now in shorts and a Navy T-shirt. Holding his laptop,
eating a banana. Stops by Luttrell’s door. Opens it. Luttrell sleeps, Murphy sits on his bed. Nudges Luttrell.
Luttrell opens an eye. He’s staring at the computer pic of an Arabian horse.
MURPHY Is this doable?
LUTTRELL Expensive.
MURPHY How much?
LUTTRELL
Arabic. She’s got good taste.
MURPHY How much?
LUTTRELL
I’ll find out. Expensive.
Murphy is up. Heads out the door. Moves into the hallway. Opens Dietz’s door.
6.
MURPHY (quiet)
Danny. Dietz. Eyes closed.
DIETZ I’m up.
10 INT. GYM - CAMP OUELLETTE 10
Dark, then lights on, revealing a decent cross fit style gym.
Blackboard filled with the current workout leaders. Dietz and Murphy hold most of them.
The two men start to stretch in silence. Luttrell wanders in. A giant bowl of cereal.
LUTTRELL
Since when does she want an Arabic
horse?
MURPHY
Since I got an email this morning.
Probably saw it on Oprah.
LUTTRELL
Oprah rides Arabic horses?
MURPHY
I don’t know what Oprah does.
LUTTRELL She can afford them.
MURPHY
Why? How much do they cost?
LUTTRELL
I don’t know. Oprah money.
Fuck.
MURPHY
LUTTRELL
I thought you guys were doing this
tomorrow.
Murphy and Dietz strap on Body Armor.
7.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) Maybe I’m starting to become tele
fucking pathic - non-verbal yoda or something. I could swear I just said outloud, that I thought this was happening tomorrow.
Murphy stretching.
MURPHY
I think Red Wings a go. Tonight.
LUTTRELL
Outstanding. SHANE PATTON wanders in.
SHANE PATTON You’re doing it now?
The three men ignore Shane.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) (to Luttrell)
They’re going at it now?
LUTTRELL Looks that way.
11 INT. MATT AXELSON’S BUNK - MORNING 11 Axe sleeps. His computer alarm goes off. Incoming voice chat. Slowly Axe reaches down for the computer on his floor.
Axe opens the computer. Signs in.
Incoming from his wife Cindy. “Are you up?”
Axe types.
“Yes my love.”
Cindy.
“What you doing?”
Axe stares at a picture of he and Cindy.
Oh.
(beat)
8.
“Looking at you.”
CINDY How do I look?
AXE Like Heaven.
12 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - MORNING 12 Dietz and Murphy both warmed up clearly ready for some kind
of competition.
Luttrell sits on a weight bench. Takes off his watch. Dietz and Murphy under pull up bars. HEALY enters.
HEALY
Thought you guys were doing this
tomorrow...
MURPHY Ready?
Yup.
DIETZ
LUTTRELL Mark. Set. Go.
Luttrell hits the stop watch.
Murphy and Dietz leap to bars, 75 Pull-ups as fast as possible. Brief pauses to recover. 100 push ups. Dietz slightly ahead of Murphy. Sprints out of the gym. Murphy close behind.
The two men charge up and over the gate. Body Armor on.
13 EXT. BAGRAM - MONTAGE - MORNING 13 Murphy and Dietz running hard racing each other on a two mile
lap of the Air Base. Luttrell keeps time.
Shane starts bench pressing. Luttrell eats cereal.
13A AXE in bunk room. On the computer with Cindy. 13A
9.
“I won’t be able to talk for a couple of days.” “Gotta go to work?”
9A.
“Got to pay the bills.”
Murphy and Dietz sprinting. Dead even. Past Marines. Down a runway full of active aircraft and helicopters.
14 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - DAY 14 Shane benching big. Luttrell munches cereal. Healy doing
pushups.
SHANE PATTON Am I going?
HEALY No idea
LUTTRELL I don’t know.
You know.
SHANE PATTON
LUTTRELL
If I say I don’t know. I don’t
know.
You know.
SHANE PATTON
LUTTRELL
If you go you’ll go. If you don’t
go, trust me you will go. Eventually. Comprende?
SHANE PATTON So, I’m not going?
LUTTRELL I didn’t say that.
SHANE PATTON
You said if you don’t go, you will
eventually go.
LUTTRELL
Yea, that’s not saying your not
going.
SHANE PATTON I’m not going.
Shane back to bench pressing. Luttrell checks his watch, heads out towards the gate.
10.
14A INT / EXT WEIGHT ROOM - DAY 14A
Other SEALs starting to gather. JAMES SUH, DAN HEALY, MIKE MCGREEVY, JAQUES FONTAN, JEFF LUCAS and JEFF TAYLOR
10A.
Dietz and Murphy balls out sprinting. Murphy has him by a few feet coming back to Ouellette iron wall. Murphy throws open the gate, runs inside.
Dietz a second behind. Luttrell looks at his watch.
LUTTRELL Murphy by 1.1.
Exhausted Dietz and Murphy sit in the dirt.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) Head shave?
DIETZ Fuck.
Axe walks up, shorts and flip flops.
AXE Who won?
LUTTRELL Murphy. Barely.
AXE Head shave?
Dietz looks pained.
MURPHY
Man...I got to think this one out.
If I shave his head, I’m going to have to look at him. Really look at him. Ears, face, funny shaped head...I don’t know. Marcus? What do you think?
LUTTRELL
I don’t know boss...I don’t want to
be looking at him that close either, but he has been running his mouth about beating you...a lot. Head shave is fair.
Axe?
MURPHY
11.
AXE
Hell yea, I say shave him, and he
can’t eat with us, make him eat with E3 Marines until it grows back. Shave the boy.
MURPHY Shane?
SHANE PATTON
Well, I could go both ways on this.
He did lose but, he was close and you’re Mike Murphy and I would have expected a much bigger separation. Plus, we’re at war and there’s the whole Samson thing, so I’m not sure. I’ll plead the fifth on this one.
Murphy looks stares at Shane.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) But you’re the boss, boss. So I’m
with you. I’ll shave his head, wax his balls if you give me the order. Sir, I’ll wax my own balls if you take me on Red Wings.
Murphy shakes his head at Patton, looks over to Dietz.
DANNY Come on Mike.
MURPHY
Yea Danny this is probably not
gonna go your way. Shane, get my razor.
SHANE PATTON Getting razor, copy that.
Erik Kristensen, officer in charge, from the deck of the Command Room.
Shane stops. Turns around.
KRISTENSEN Not today.
The SEALs stare up at their boss.
KRISTENSEN (CONT’D) Red Wing’s a go. Today. 1800.
12.
SHANE PATTON Am I going?
KRISTENSEN (ignoring Shane)
PLO in one hour.
Sir?
SHANE PATTON
Kristensen dead eyes Patton. Turns and heads back into TOC. Healy follows
AXE Shane’s going?
MURPHY I don’t think so.
They all walk inside.
SHANE Maybe.
15 INT. RED WINGS PLO (PATROL LEADER’S ORDER) 15
Thirty SEALs plus support packed into the TOC (Tactical Operational Command). Makeshift control center. PowerPoint on flat screen. Operation REDWING is dissected.
MURPHY
Operation Red Wings. The target is
Ahmad Shah and his, we are estimating ten men, “loyal amigos”. Including, this dude,
Slide shifts to a color photo of “Taraq”.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Only have a first name, Taraq.
Seems to do most of the chief shit for Shah.
SEALs study photos.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
We’re going in with a four man team. The recon team is Dietz, Comms. Axe, Nav. Luttrell, Medic.
HEALY
Objective of this mission is to positively identify Ahmad Shah.
Shane’s head in his hands, pissed he is not going...a grainy photo of Ahmad Shah on a large color monitor. PowerPoint.
13.
KRISTENSEN
This is the best picture we have of him. It’s current.
(MORE)
13A.
KRISTENSEN (CONT'D) We know Shah killed fourteen
Marines last Tuesday in Kandahar. We just pulled this video off three different Tali web sights. It will in fact be a glorious day when Ahmad Shah and his good friend Taraq are no longer members of our human community.
Clear video of Shah executing a Taliban woman. Two men hold her down. Shah fires an AK-47. The bullet kicking up dust as it blasts through her skull into the dirt.
The SEALs study this footage. Dead serious.
AXE
Go back...freeze.
Axe studies an image of Shah.
AXE (CONT’D) No earlobes.
MURPHY What’s that?
AXE
The guys got no earlobes.
Silence as the team studies the image.
SHANE
earlobes for anyway?
DIETZ
and balance.
SHANE
DIETZ
I heard earlobes are key for head
balance - equilibrium. Cut a guys ear off, he’s gonna suck on a drunk test, balance beam, tight rope...
LUTTRELL
False. Earlobes have no biological
functions for humans. Fish can use earlobes like a valve to open or close the ear canal.
What are Piercing Balance.
14.
SHANE
Why would a fish want to let water
into his ear canal?
Luttrell shoots him a look - “shut the fuck up”
14A.
Murphy keeps things moving.
MURPHY
Bad guy. Senior Taliban commander
responsible for killing Marines in Eastern Afghanistan and sport killing civilians in the Hindu- Kush. Considered Tier One target rumored to be close to Bin Laden. Axe is going to go over our route in.
AXE
The helo pilots are going to do two
false inserts. Then drop us off at our primary insert, located here. Secondary insert located here. From our primary insert, our bearing will be zero three zero patrolling 1.5 kilometers to our designated lay up point. We will be moving up the backside of this mountain which will offer us good concealment from the target but the terrain is gonna be rocky so watch your footing. I’m estimating it’s gonna take us about two hours to complete.
MURPHY Luttrell - medical
LUTTRELL
First things first, win the fight.
There’s no medicine in a gunfight. It’s self aid, buddy aid, corpsman aide. Two weeks ago, Team 3 was near where you guys will be. Capelli got bit by a rattlesnake. and contrary to popular belief, there is poison oak, so watch the cock and balls cause that will suck. Drink lots of water, wear sunscreen, and Dietz bring your own chapstick.
Dietz stands up, starts talking comms
DIETZ
Crypto will be wide band, segment 2-
4. Murph’s got a SAT phone. Region is very steep so expect typical comms problems. We’ll be on two hour comms windows.
(MORE)
15.
DIETZ (CONT'D)
If we miss two windows I’d say wake somebody up. Other than that, don’t
sweat it.
Murphy picks up a plastic AC-130 and holds it over the map.
MURPHY AC-130 is with us?
15A.
Dietz takes the plane from Murphy. Moves it over the map.
DIETZ
Correct. Just for the infil. All
comms will be relayed through the AC-130, call sign Apollo. Suns up, she’s out. Some of the key pro- words - when we have a successful insert, Budweiser. When we’re halfway through infil, it’ll be Corona. At our observation point, Schlitz Malt Liquor. And if we positively identify Shah: touchdown.
Danny chucks the toy plane.
MURPHY
Reaction Force is the following:
The 47’s will relocate to J-Bad overnight.
Murphy uses toy plastic helicopters to explain the size and location of the QRF.
KRISTENSEN
That’s correct. You’ll have fifteen
team guys, and about a dozen Marines standing by all night. When we hear Schlitz Malt Liquor, we’re heading back to Bagram for phase 2. QRF will stay here - we’re leaving you with 4 team guys, 20 marines, 2 Blackhawks and 2 Apaches. The Apaches stay with the Blackhawks.
The toy Choppers circle on the map giving us a clear understanding of the playing field.
KRISTENSEN (CONT’D) The movement is so we can get the
47’s back here and be ready to bring it for phase two once you get eyes on Shah. Remember - comms will most likely be intermittent and there are reports that non- combatants are being used as recon elements for the enemy.
MURPHY Roger that.
Luttrell spits chew. Danny doodles furious, mashing demons. Axe quietly studies the picture of Ahmad Shah.
16.
JAG GOES OVER RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
AXE Lotta moving parts.
MURPHY
What we do, when we do, what we do.

MURPHY
So just let her do it. It’s good
for her. You got a handy man woman. That’s good.

DIETZ I don’t know.
What?
MURPHY
AXE
He’s worried that he’s losing
control over his castle.
MURPHY Really.
AXE Ask him.
MURPHY
Are you worried that you’re losing
control over your castle?
DIETZ Shut up Murph.
MURPHY Are you?
LUTTRELL
He’s having control issues cause
he’s the one whose always made the “taste” issues in the family.
DIETZ
She’s got great taste. I trust her.
MURPHY
So what’s the problem?
DIETZ
It’s not a problem. It’s just very
ongoing. Know what I mean?
Luttrell kills a fly. He’s got six dead ones. He and Murphy are competing.
18.
MURPHY
Not really. No. Marcus, you know
what he means? LUTTRELL
Control issues.
MURPHY Is that right?
DIETZ LUTTRELL DIETZ
No.
Yes.
It’s not control issues.
MURPHY What is it?

MURPHY Got it.
LUTTRELL

go bro.
DIETZ
It’s like this weird journey that
she’s on. Moving through the house one room to the next.
AXE Where is she now?
DIETZ Kitchen. I think.
Murphy and Luttrell both kill flies at the same time. Marines with Buzz cuts in crisp uniform eating all around the SEALs. Stark contrast.
19.
CUT TO:
18 INT. SEAL TV ROOM 18
Tight on Shane Patton. Doing his best Napoleon Dynamite dance. He is not good. SEALs in lounge chairs. They watch, laugh and taunt. Music loud. Shane powers through. Finishes strong.
Whistles and clapping from the SEALs. AXE stands up. Puts an arm around Patton.
HEALY God was that awful
AXE
Ok, here’s the deal. That sucked,
but I’m voting that we move him forward cause I can’t watch this shit without puking anymore so I say lest be done with it. All in favor?
Luttrell and all SEALs put their hands up, except Murphy.
AXE (CONT’D) Come on Mikey.
MURPHY Can he say it?
Other SEALs agree. Shouting out. Debating whether Shane can “say it”. Making bets.
AXE knows what Murphy is thinking. Pauses. Looks at Shane.
AXE (quiet to Shane)
Can you say it?
SHANE PATTON I think so.
AXE Think so?
SHANE PATTON I can say it.
20.
AXE
Ok. Shut up. Shut the fuck up. He
can say it. Shut up.
The room silences. Patton, nervous, takes a deep breath.
SHANE PATTON (weak, then strong)
I’ve been around the world twice, talked to everyone once. I’ve seen two whales fuck, been to three world fairs, and I even know a man in Thailand with a wooden cock. I’ve pushed more peter, more sweeter, and more completer than any other peter-pusher around.
Tight on the SEALs smiling, some mouthing the words along with Shane.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D)
I am a hard-bodied, hairy-chested,
rootin, tootin, shootin, parachutin, demolition double cap crimping Frogman.
19 INT. CAMP OUELLETTE SEAL COMPOUND - READY ROOM 19 The entire SEAL TEAM jocks up. Gets ready.
SHANE PATTON (vo)
There ain’t nothing I can’t do. No sky too high, no sea too rough, no Muff too tough. I’ve learned a lot of lessons in my life. Never shoot a large caliber man with a small caliber bullet.

AXE going over his infil map.
LUTTRELL double checking all medical supplies.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) (vo)
I’m a lover, I’m a fighter, I’m a UDT/SEAL Diver. I’ll wine, dine, intertwine and then sneak out the back door when the refueling is done.
MURPHY watching all of it.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) If your feeling froggy than you
better jump because this Frogman has been there, done that and is going back for more.
20 EXT. CHOPPER PAD BAGRAM 20
Sun setting over the Afghan desert. Thirty SEALs laying on the deck on their gear. Chilling out waiting for the 47’s. The guys laying around. Danny studies a piece of paper with color tile samples printed on it.
MURPHY
Seems to me like you’ve got to
straighten this shit out. DANNY
There’s nothing to straighten out.
AXE
If there’s nothing to straighten,
why are you fighting?
DANNY We’re not fighting?
AXE
Well, what is it that you’re doing?
DANNY
We’re more like disagreeing.
22.
AXE Disagreeing or arguing?
DANNY
Probably more like mildly arguing.
Just because you’re Mr. Perfect marriage, don’t be judging us mortal marriages who occasionally have mild disagreements, sometimes even loving arguments.
MURPHY
It’s a fucking stupid loving
argument.
DANNY
It’s not an argument.
LUTTRELL
It is an argument. Sounded like a couple of bighorn rams smashing skulls.
DANNY
What the fuck is everyone listening
to my shit for?
LUTTRELL Bro, you’re loud.
DANNY
You’re louder than I am.
LUTTRELL
Just pick some tile and move the
fuck on.
DANNY
I picked the tile. She doesn’t like
it.
LUTTRELL
What does she fucking like?
DANNY (reading from paper)
“Rose Honey Dew”
LUTTRELL Say what bro?
DANNY
She likes rose honey
dew...something.
23.
LUTTRELL
Are you fucking kidding me?
DANNY That’s what she likes.
LUTTRELL
You gotta control that situation.
AXE
Rose tiles in the kitchen?
DANNY
Can we talk about something else?
AXE
Yea let’s talk about what she’s
gonna tile your bathroom in. DANNY
I don’t wanna talk about that.
MURPHY
(Ron Burgandy impersonation)
Danny? I’m gonna put it out there, if you like it, you can take it, if you don’t, send it right back.

100 stone and wood homes, well-constructed. Looks almost charming. A couple of dozen Afghan villagers in different parts of the village, kids playing, women cooking, two men working on a roof. Looks quite peaceful.
Left: trying to see the rest of the village. Can’t get a good view, a mountain is blocking his view.

MURPHY (CONT’D)
Let’s move down towards that peak,
see if that’s not better.
LUTTRELL Sounds good.

As the team sets up, Dietz is looking up at the small mountain behind him that seems to be killing his radio.
Series of shots:
Murphy and Luttrell scopes up, start counting Taliban. At forty, Luttrell looks to Murphy.
LUTTRELL That’s more than 10.
Yes.

Silver?
LUTTRELL
MURPHY
Hi-Ho Silver. Lone Ranger’s horse.
LUTTRELL
Yea that’s a badass horse.
MURPHY
She doesn’t want a badass horse.
She wants an Arabic horse.
LUTTRELL
Dude, how’s she going to know the
difference. Get her a Quarter Horse, tell her it’s an Arabic. If she busts you, tell her if it’s good enough for the Lone Ranger...
MURPHY
How much for an Arabic?
LUTTRELL Probably around 15 grand.

Nothing moves.
BACK to Danny. Eyes more focused. He slowly reaches down and kills the iPod.

A large male goat.
Bell ringing gently from his neck.

As another goat appears. Then another...then another...then twenty...
A herd of goats moving up the hill right at them.
Marcus is wide awake, eyes scanning the hill scanning the goats when...
A human head crests the hill. A young Afghan BOY, ten years old.
Luttrell reaches for his Mark 12, looks over to Axe still sleeping. Then to Murph still sleeping. Then back to Danny.
Danny’s already on scope. Gun aimed at the approaching kid when...
Two more Afghan MEN crest the hill - an old man and a teenager.
The hill is full of goats. More than a hundred with the three Afghans moving straight at the SEALs.
The goat bells and baying of the animals creating serious noise. Murph and Axe both waking up.
Weapons coming up as they silently take in this bizarre situation.

LUTTRELL Get the fuck down.
Axe, Danny, and Murphy. Guns up moving in fast on the terrified goat men...
DANNY Down Down Down.
The kid screams and starts running downhill towards the village. AXE sprints on him fast, takes the kid down, hand over mouth.
Kid bites and struggles wild.
Goats running in fear as the three Afghans are roughly thrown down. Searched, a military style Motorola walkie talkie taken from the old man, flex-cuffed and gagged...
When it’s done the four SEALs stand over them. Murphy looking at Luttrell.

37.
They have separated the older man from the boys. Murphy and Luttrell have them off to the side.. Axe stands watch over the boy.
MURPHY
(speaking into the Phrase-
O-Later)
Are you looking for Americans?
A robotic-like voice used for making out the question in Arabic.
The old man stares at Murphy with a combination of hatred and confusion.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Do the Taliban know we are up here?
Death stare from the old man. Murphy getting frustrated. Louder.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Do they know?
The old man stares, finally says something quiet. Too quiet for the translating machine. Murphy puts the mic closer.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Say again. Are you Taliban?
The old man rants on as the machine struggles to translate his slang Pashtun.
TRANSLATION MACHINE
Do not drink with many blood rooms
fire and knives...
MURPHY
This fuckin thing’s not working...
The machine starts translating what Murphy is saying.

SHANE PATTON (CONT’D)
KRISTENSEN (oc)
What?
SHANE PATTON
Sir sorry sir. I’ve got Lieutenant
Murphy on the phone in the TOC. Says he needs to talk to you. Now.
A moment, then Kristensen’s door flies open. Kristensen in his underwear, flip flops, moving out, clearly just waking up.
39A Track with them as Kristensen moves back into the TOC. 39A Reaches for the phone.
KRISTENSEN (into phone)
Mike? Silence Static.
KRISTENSEN (CONT'D) Mike...? Mike...? Try him back.
PATTON reads Murphy’s SAT phone number off the board. Dials. Waits. Nothing. Tries again nothing.
KRISTENSEN (CONT'D) Is it dead?
SHANE PATTON
Yes sir. What’d he want?
KRISTENSEN
44.
SHANE PATTON No idea sir.
KRISTENSEN Did he say anything?
SHANE PATTON
Just that he needed to speak to
you.
KRISTENSEN Anything wrong?
SHANE PATTON Didn’t say sir.
Stay with Kristensen a bit concerned. Looking at the map of the Valley.
TIGHT ON KRISTENSEN
Thinking.....
40 EXT. HINDU KUSH MOUNTAIN 40 Murphy trying his IRIDIUM SAT phone one more time.
MURPHY
Can someone explain to me why they
both crash at the same time?
LUTTRELL AXE
Murphy’s law. Murphy’s law
Now a last resort. Murphy keys his personal radio. An MBITR
walkie talkie mounted on the side of his chest.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Spartan 01 to anyone. Spartan 01 to
anyone listening. Over.
LUTTRELL
We could light these goats on fire
and smoke signal our way out of here.
DANNY
I could go down to the village and
ask to borrow a phone.
Murphy just stares at the goat herders.
45.
MURPHY
(quietly to himself)
Fuck.
LUTTRELL
You’d get some interesting tile
ideas down there bro. Afghan Dirt Brown. Goat skin blond, she’ll dig that a hell of a lot more than what is it Honey creme...?
The goat noise is now really loud. Dogs barking and Axe is getting focused. Doing the math.
The kid bolts. Hands cuffed behind his back, he’s still fast as shit.
AXE Fuck me.
He charges again after the kid. Tackles him. Drags him back. AXE breathing hard. Looking at Murphy.
MURPHY
I’m thinking three ways this plays
out.
All eyes on Murphy. His brain churning.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
We let em go, we’re gonna fight. So
we can 1) Tie em up. Move out. Probably take them 15 minutes to get out. 2) Let em go. We hike out. Roll dice.
DIETZ Three?
AXE
Three, soft Compromise. Terminate
the compromise.
Axe stares at Murphy. Third choice is obvious.
Murphy looks up to the mountain top a mile behind them.
MURPHY
Can we get a signal from that
mountain?
46.
DANNY
I thought about that. Probably. I
don’t fucking know.
More dog barking, goat baying, bells ringing. The kids are staring rage into the eyes of the Americans.
DANNY (CONT’D) We gotta do something boss.
MURPHY
Yea.
Murphy walks back down to Luttrell and Axe.
MURPHY (CONT’D) What do you think?
LUTTRELL
They don’t seem to like us very
much.
MURPHY A pause. Reality setting in.
AXE
Shah’s down there. We let them go,
Shaw disappears. Mission fails.
MURPHY What? Kill them.
Axe stares at Murphy.
Murphy staring at Axe. Realizing how serious he is.
AXE
We are compromised Mike.
Marcus spits out some chew. Looking down, he shakes his head. A pained grin plasters his face.
Yea.
Shit.
LUTTRELL
47.
MURPHY Danny?
Danny takes a long look at the goat herders. Finally...
DANNY
I don’t give a shit what you
decide. I’m not a lawyer. Just tell me what to do Murph. You’re the big bucks, earn em’.
Murphy turns to Marcus.
MURPHY Marcus?
LUTTRELL I don’t know Mikey.
Luttrell takes his time. The goats sound like they are howling. The vibe on the mountain is becoming deathly serious.
LUTTRELL (CONT'D)
I don’t know. I don’t like it. We
kill them. Yea ok. We kill them. Bury them. They get found. Then what...
AXE Then what?
LUTTRELL
I’m just saying. It ain’t gonna be
private. Gonna be out there for the whole fucking world. CNN -- SEALs kill goat farmers. I don’t want that legacy, bro. I’m not killing goat farmers. Not feeling that.
48.
AXE
I’m not either, but the
Old man’s Tali and these kids can shoot better than you can.
LUTTRELL
Let’s just tie ‘em up and get the
fuck out of here.
AXE
We tie them up, we have no control over when they get found; get free. I will die before I let them dictate when we die. I will not end up showing your body -- your head -- on television. On the Computer. No way, they do not get that vote.
LUTTRELL
Then let’s just get the fuck out of
here.
I will do this, I will kill them right now. They will not harm you or me or my wife or your wife or any of our unborn children. No. These people are death and I will not fucking bow to this.
MURPHY
You want to kill, Axe? Really?
That’s your position?
AXE
I want to be playing golf with
Freddie Couples on Pebble Beach, but I’m having a little trouble getting a tee time.
LUTTRELL
If we kill these kids, it’s International news. CNN doesn’t care about Rules of Engagement. SEALs kill kids. That’s the story. Forever.
Tight on the guys taking this in. Murphy paces, staring intensely at one of the goat kids.
MURPHY
Axe what’s your call?
AXE
49.
Axe stares at Murphy.
AXE (sad grin)
My final answer?
49A.
MURPHY Your final answer.
AXE Kill them.
This hits hard.
MURPHY Danny?
Dietz stares at the tied up kids.
DANNY It’s your call bro.
MURPHY
You don’t have an opinion?
DANNY
Yea I have an opinion. Two
opinions. One is that for the record I don’t give a fuck what anyone thinks about what the fuck we do up here. We do what we do. What we have to do. That’s it. That’s our business.
MURPHY What’s two?
DANNY
Two is, this is the Navy and you’re
the boss and your job is to be the boss and my job is to do what I’m fucking told.
Ok.
MURPHY
DANNY
So you tell me what to do and it
will be done. Murphy looks to Marcus.
MURPHY
Marcus what’s your call?
Luttrell seems to get that with Danny out, Murphy’s for letting them go, Axe wants them dead - he’s the tie-breaker.
50.
ON MURPHY.
LUTTRELL
(slowly shaking his head)
No. I’d rather fight them straight up. I don’t want to kill these kids.
Thinking. He looks around the area. Looking for a burial spot. Stabbing at the stone earth with his M4. Clearly no soft earth anywhere close.
MURPHY (quiet)
Fuck me.
Murphy stares down at the Afghan village. Then long and hard at the three Afghans. Finally turns back to goat herders.
DANNY
Look at them. They fucking hate us.
We don’t know how many Hajji’s they have down there. We can’t let them go.
LUTTRELL
So now you have an opinion? I
thought you were standing by waiting for your orders?
AXE
This opp is a soup sandwich. Been so from the beginning. The pitch. The rope. Worst comms that I’ve ever seen. Soft intel, we are not wearing vests, have no heavy weapons, are weak in numbers.... It’s a cursed opp.
MURPHY
Starting to feel like a cursed opp.
LUTTRELL
It’s not a cursed opp. There are no fucking curses. Just Afghanistan. That’s all. Everyday man. Devil’s asshole.
AXE
Shah just killed twenty marines
last week and we’re on him. We’ve come this far and these people here are him. They are a part of him. We let them go.
(MORE)
51.
AXE (CONT'D)
We’re letting him go and why in the
fucking world does he have the right to do that to us?
Axe is starring at LUTTRELL.
51A.
Silence.
AXE.
Seriously Marcus. Why does he have
the right to do that to us?
LUTTRELL
I don’t see it that way.
MURPHY
So what is your fucking call bro?
LUTTRELL
Let them go. Shut it down.
So if Murphy was taking a vote it seems like it’s one vote for killing them, one vote for letting them go, Danny is neutral.
This is all on MURPHY.
Murphy turns away from them, looking down the steep pitched mountain. The village far below.
Murphy thinks. Looks at the young kids. The old man.
MURPHY
Here’s what we’re gonna do. Pack
up. Everything. We’re gonna let ‘em go and we’re gonna make the peak. When we make the peak were gonna make Comms. We’re calling QRF and we’re getting out.
Silence as the guys take in the plan. Luttrell lets out a huge breath.
MURPHY (CONT’D) That’s what we’re going to do.
DANNY Roger that.
LUTTRELL Yes sir.
MURPHY Let’s move it.
Quick Shots.
The guys quickly breaking down their gear. The goat boy watching confused.
52.
The older Goat herders. Defiant. Steel-eyed.
52A.
41 INT. SEAL TOC. BAGRAM. 41
Kristensen, Patton with Petty Officer Dan Healy, James Suh and some COMMS guys.
The Comms guys trying to get Spartan 01 back on line.
COMMS GUY
Spartan 01, Spartan 01, over.
Kristensen is on the phone, communicating with J-Bad TOC
KRISTENSEN
When was your last contact with
Spartan 01?
42 EXT. J-BAD TOC. 42 The two Blackhawks standing by with the two Apaches.
The Apache pilots are firing up their engines.
Musslemen comes out of a pilot station.
MUSSLEMEN
Where are you guys going?
APACHE PILOT
We just got called North. By an
Army 372, evidently they took some small fire.
MUSSLEMEN
We’re QRF, bro.
APACHE PILOT
That’s what we thought. BAGRAM is
now QRF.
The 47s?
Correct.
Are we not the QRF now?
APACHE PILOT That’s my understanding.
Mussleman is a bit confused...
MUSSLEMEN
APACHE PILOT
MUSSLEMEN
53.
Apache pilots climb into their two birds. Take off.
43 EXT. MOUNTAIN 43
10 MINUTES LATER:
Gear packed the four SEALs stand over the Afghans.
MURPHY CONT’D Everybody good?
Quick nods from the team as Murphy’s flip knife comes out. He quickly cuts through the flex cuffs. Freeing the Afghans.
MURPHY
You three just won the lottery.
Speak well of us.
An odd moment as the Afghans stare at the SEALs. Not fully understanding that they are free to leave.
Go!
MURPHY (CONT’D)
The little goat boy stares at Murphy. A beat then gets it. Turning fast he takes off sprinting down the hill.
The old man holds a beat. Says something quietly to the team. Sounds fairly ominous.
Then he too turns and slowly, deliberately starts making his way down the long steep mountain.
Murphy looks at the team.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Let’s move it.
The four SEALs, full gear, start moving up the mountain.
There is no trail. Just steep rocks, fallen trees, and a brutal pitch.
43A THE YOUNG GOAT BOY. 43A RUNNING DOWN THE HILL.
54.
Leaping over rocks. Fallen trees. The kid’s movements are beautiful. Mountain agility in his DNA. Virtually FLYING down the mountain.
43B UP TOP. 43B
Slow going for the SEALs. Murphy leading. Danny, loaded up with COMMS, second. Luttrell breathing hard. Axe bringing up the rear.
On AXE
Constantly checking behind him.
His left foot catches on some loose granite. Gives out.
Axe rolls his ankle hard. Slips, falls hard sliding fast tumbling and smashing hard into a fallen tree stump.
Sprained right ankle and bruised left ribs.
Murphy stops, looking back as Luttrell moves down to Axe. Axe struggling back on his feet.
You ok?
LUTTRELL.
AXE Fucking Afghanistan.
LUTTRELL.
Yea. I’m the one who’s supposed to
be falling.
AXE I’m fine.
He takes a step. White flash of burst pain tears through him. He buckles. Clearly not alright.
43C THE GOAT KID 43C Running hard approaching the village.
43D UP TOP. 43D Luttrell reaches for him. Axe pulls away.
AXE (CONT'D) I’m good. Let’s go.
Axe digs his foot in. Grinds through the pain and starts back up the hill.
55.
AXE (CONT'D)
Maybe we should just hike down to
the village, ask to borrow a phone.
Tight on Murphy’s small smile as he digs it up the hill. The group now moving even slower cause of Axe’s ankle.
44 EXT. THE VILLAGE. 44
Quiet. A couple of small fires. Some cooking. A group of young boys playing with sticks. Women cooking as - The young GOAT BOY comes tearing, full sprint into the village.
TIGHT ON THE GOAT BOY. Eyes wide. Screaming for Shah.
Villagers start to gather. Shah approaches the boys. Breathing hard, they point up the mountain.
A couple of Taliban hear this. Take off into the woods.
TRACKING with the two Taliban.
As they sprint deeper into the woods. Into the Taliban camp.
Taliban soldiers sleeping. The two find Shah and Taraq. Tell them about the Americans.
Shah quickly on his walkie talkie, old school but deathly effective. Rounding up his fighters.
Quick shots of the Taliban army. Feels like 150 men. Arming themselves. AK’s, RPG’s, grenades, a lot of ammo. Radio gear.
Quiet, cool, professional. These Afghan soldiers are loading up big time...
45 EXT. UP MOUNTAIN. 45 The SEALs cresting the hill.
Fuck.
MURPHY
He’s looking up at a larger hill in front of them. They have just ascended a false summit. Still blocked in by another very steep mountain.
Danny?
MURPHY (CONT'D)
56.
Dietz is already into the radio, as Luttrell and Axe spread out, digging in, guns pointed down hill.
Nothing.
DANNY (on radio)
Anvil 1 this is Spartan 01, over.
MURPHY Great.
Comms still clearly dead. Murphy weighing his options. They are high above the village. Murphy pulls out binoculars. Scanning the village and mountain.
All three SEALs on glass. SCANNING. SEALS POV
Nothing moving. From their vantage the town seems quiet. Business as usual.
They cannot see the Taliban off in the woods. They are OBLIVIOUS to the magnitude of the threat.
CUT TO:
46 TWENTY MINUTES LATER. 46
Danny still working the radio. Axe has tightened his boot. Murphy and Luttrell have spread out on the hill. Staring down at the village.
Murphy’s got his SAT phone out. Trying to get a signal. Can’t.
He’s looking with disgust at the mountain behind him, knowing that it’s blocking his signal.
MURPHY (to mountain)
Move Bitch.
Luttrell’s fifteen feet to his left.
LUTTRELL What do you want to do?
MURPHY
Go home, get in bed, and watch
Anchorman.
57.
Check.
LUTTRELL
MURPHY I wanna be on you.
LUTTRELL
Roger that. Should I spread the
word?
MURPHY
Not just yet. Let’s hold up for an
hour and see just how big of a can of hell we’ve opened.
LUTTRELL What do you think?
MURPHY
We did the right thing. We let our
love light shine. God ought to be smiling down on us. Isn’t that how it works? Good things happen to good people?
LUTTRELL
You think they’re coming after us?
MURPHY
Like a pack of wild dogs.
MURPHY keys his radio.
MURPHY (CONT’D) What say you Axe?
AXE (on radio)
I’m fine.
Murphy looks up behind him to the large cliff.
MURPHY (to Axe)
You good to go?
AXE
No problems boss.
MURPHY
Here’s the deal. Lay low here.
Soon as the sun sets we move.
(MORE)
58.
MURPHY (CONT'D)
If we can’t get comms from that top we’re probably gonna have to walk home anyway, so get some rest. Axe you’re first security. We move in about sixty minutes.
46A THIRTY MINUTES LATER. 46A Murphy, Danny, and Marcus. Hats low. Eyes closed. Danny on
the glass.
It’s quiet. Sun getting low. Probably two hours of sunlight left.
ON AXE.
Calmly checking down hill, whistling very quietly to himself.
Tight on Luttrell resting.
Danny. Eyes closed. One arm around his radio.
Murphy. Eyes open. Staring up at the sky.
Back to Axe. Focused down range.
Down the mountain. Something appears to move. Axe misses it. Hold a beat. More movement.
Just catches Axe’s peripheral... Axe shifts his gaze. Focusing.
THEN
More movement. Axe sees it, raises his gun eye to the scope. Gently scanning the area of movement.
Stops whistling.
AXE’S POV:
No movement.
Axe slowly pans his M-4 across the hill. Suddenly A FLASH OF SOMETHING HUMAN.
A HUMAN. He pans a bit more to the right. Then two more.
AXE pans way to the right. Almost as high as the SEALs are and he see’s more movement.
They are almost surrounded.
TIGHT ON LUTTRELL eyes still closed.
59.
MURPHY (CONT'D) (oc)
Sssst! Sssst!
Luttrell lifts up his hat and looks left.
Sees Axe, rigid, in firing position, his rifle aimed straight up the mountain.
MURPHY (CONT'D) (to Danny)
Try and call it in.
Danny desperate to get the radio to work.
Luttrell fixes his Mark 12 into firing position looks through scope down hill.
LUTTRELL’S POV.
Lined along the top are at least a dozen heavily armed Taliban warriors, each one of them with an AK pointing downward. Some carrying rocket propelled grenades.
LUTTRELL looks left.
More Taliban coming down hill to flank them. Luttrell looks right.
More Taliban.
The SEALs are FUCKED.
MURPHY (CONT'D)
How the fuck fast are these little
bastards? All four SEALs guns up.
Marcus in the middle, Axe and Danny up to his left. Murphy twenty feet off to his right. Marcus slowly belly crawls towards Murphy.
MURPHY (CONT'D) What are you thinking?
LUTTRELL
I’m thinking that we’re about
fixing to get into a pretty good gunfight.
Yea.
MURPHY
60.
LUTTRELL
Looks like I voted wrong.
MURPHY
Negative. We’ve been given the
opportunity to reach out and make some hell fucking strong contact with our friends from the other side. Job well done.
LUTTRELL Hoo-yah to that sir.
ON DANNY AND AXE
Looking up the hill which is now swarming with Taliban. Dozens of soldiers flowing down hill flanking them.
DANNY Do they see us?
AXE Dunno.
BACK TO MARCUS.
His back pressed up against a tree, inventorying his ammo. Grenades. Knife.
Danny, Axe, Murphy all doing the same. Readying for war.
Axe and Danny sneak quick looks at the pictures of their wives taped inside their helmets.
The trap tightening around all of them. All four focused up hill.
A TREE TWENTY FEET IN FRONT OF MARCUS.
A flash of a turban. Glint of an AK Barrel pointed in his general direction.
Luttrell tightens the grip of his rifle slowly starts pointing it in the direction of the man behind the tree.
Luttrell eyes on glass, still as marble. Aimed at the tree.
Marcus looks over his shoulder at Murphy whose gun is also trained on the tree.
Marcus eyes back on the scope. SCOPE POV:
61.
A fierce-eyed Taliban warrior peering straight into the scope. Black eyes and thick black beard. The barrel of his AK pointed dead on Luttrell.
Hold.
THEN.
Luttrell fires once. Blowing the man’s head off.
An odd brief moment of silence as the head shot Afghan stumbles, still standing, still clutching his AK-47. He takes three more steps towards Luttrell.
Stops.
Luttrell shoots again removes what’s left of the fighter’s head.
The Afghan starts to fall and as he hits the ground, all HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
From above and half way down both flanks the Taliban open fire.
Screaming at each other, communicating through violent, loud bursts of Pashto, the Taliban moving fast down the hill. Agile and fearless, not weighted down with US-style gear, they are able to leap boulders, fallen trees.
Taraq in the middle of the pack on the top of the SEALs. UP TOP - Shah calmly giving orders into his radio comms.
ON MURPHY.
Taliban moving down the hill on both sides. Shooting as they move.
A solid line of at least fifty Taliban in firing positions on top of the hill above them.
The SEALs are close to being surrounded.
MURPHY checks his rear.
MURPHY POV
A cliff. More of a series of cliffs. Multiple death falls. First one is at least 300 feet.
Murphy calls it.
Push right flank.
MURPHY
62.
Axe the farthest right starts shooting and moving right INTO the wall of the Taliban flanking his right.
Luttrell follows staying low, shooting, Danny firing with one arm. Desperate to get the radio up.
DANNY
Spartan 01 reporting major enemy
contact. We need help. Spartan 01 reporting major enemy contact. Request immediate QRF! Spartan 01 requesting immediate QRF.
Murphy’s doing the same with his SAT phone. He’s moving right trying to dial up the TOC. Not getting through.
Danny’s left two fingers HIT. Dangling bloody and mangled.
He tries to put them back into his hand. Jams his ring finger back into its socket. His pinkie is beyond repair.
DANNY (CONT’D)
Marcus!
Luttrell turns, Danny holds up his fucked up hand.
LUTTRELL Wrap it up bro.
DANNY Roger that.
Taliban gunfire is picking up. Axe the deepest right kills two Taliban. Two more immediately fill their positions.
MURPHY
Danny did you get the call through?
DANNY
I made the call. Don’t know if it
went through. You?
MURPHY
I couldn’t get a line.
DANNY Fuck.
Marcus is pushing right behind Axe trying to break the right Taliban flank.
Charging the Ambush.
63.
MURPHY
Keep pushing right. Kill ‘em all.
The four SEALs fighting well as a team. Crawling, shooting and covering as they start making progress killing their way into the right side of the Taliban ambush.
The Taliban close enough to see clearly.
Axe shot through the left shoulder. Ignoring it he keeps firing. His long scope making him very accurate. As he shoots deep into the left flank.
TALIBAN POV:
From behind at least 12 Tabliban fighters pushing deeper into the right side.
Two more Taliban hit. The remaining start taking solid covering positions, firing down at the four SEALs.
Axe being the closest takes the majority of the firepower.
Decent cover from a granite boulder which is getting hacked to pieces by the incoming AK fire.
Razor sharp stone shrapnel chunks slicing into Axe’s face and neck. Blood runs down his face drips off his chin.
Luttrell getting equally shot up. Returning fire. His cover rock getting shot up bad. Chunks of granite tearing into his face and neck.
FURTHER to the left, Danny and Murphy shooting, trying to get closer to Luttrell and Axe.
Danny takes another round, blowing clear through his right thigh shattering his right femur. Blood, muscle chunks and bone tear through his pants.
DANNY Goddammitt.
Pissed he keeps moving. Firing. Ignoring his two gunshots. Hand and Leg.
Danny moves up with Murphy behind some decent cover.
MURPHY Can you fight?
DANNY Roger that.
64.
MURPHY
Want me to take the radio?
DANNY Negative.
Murphy looks up towards Axe who is far right.
MURPHY (yelling)
AXE?!
AXE Sir!
MURPHY
Can we break that flank? Hold
this, we’re gonna push left!
Axe gets shot through the top of his shoulder the bullet tearing down through his shoulder and burning deep inside his chest.
Axe keeps firing, hitting a Taliban in the knee. The Taliban fires back at Axe missing but sending sharp rock chips shearing up off the granite into Axe’s face. Shredding his right ear, cutting into his eyeballs.
Half blind. Watery out of focus images as sweat mixed with blood. Axe struggles to see. When his vision clears up enough to focus:
AXE POV.
Two Tali fighters. Moving fast out of cover, right at AXE. Directly at the Americans. SEAL style. Attacking the counter attack.
The Taliban are close to the half blind Axe. Axe fires blind. Misses. The Taliban almost on him. Then:
One of the Tali hit with a round from Luttrell, killed. The other, wounded, falls on Axe. Vicious hand-to-hand fight.
Luttrell runs up to help Axe. Takes the remaining Taliban soldier out with a point-blank headshot.
From the right, a BELT FED MACHINE GUN opens up on their position.
Marcus and Axe start moving left. Both shot during the move - Marcus in his right butt-cheek, Axe in his right thigh.
65.
47 INT. TOC. BAGRAM 47 Comms guy at radio. Checking wall clock. See’s Kristensen,
Shane, and some of the other Team 10 guys.
COMMS GUY
Spartan 01 is about to miss a comms
second window.
65A.
How long?
KRISTENSEN
COMMS GUY 2 hours 15 minutes.
Tight on Kristensen. Thinking. Checking the clock.
KRISTENSEN Call me if they miss two.
COMMS GUY Roger that.
48 EXT. ON THE MOUNTAIN 48 CHAOS.
A massive barrage of gunfire erupting from the right Taliban flank.
AXE Right is no good.
Murphy looks left. He can see twenty Taliban moving into firing positions.
MURPHY Fuck me.
The first RPG comes from the left side. Hitting just short of Danny and Murphy. Blasting them backwards. Covering them with dirt and rock.
Luttrell swings his gun left and starts firing into the left Taliban position.
Mikey? Yea? You ok?
LUTTRELL MURPHY LUTTRELL MURPHY
We’re good.
A bullet slams in Murphy’s lower stomach.
MURPHY (CONT’D) This is no good.
66.
LUTTRELL Roger that.
MURPHY
Can we break that right flank?
LUTTRELL Negative. We got to go left.
MURPHY Negative.
From downhill, two RPG’s fire at their position.
Dietz takes a shot in his upper-right chest.
A massive double RPG explosion. Tears away chunks of granite. Shrapnel cutting deep into all four SEALs. They are now clearly under attack from all three sides.
LUTTRELL
We can take ‘em Mikey but I’m
thinking we’re gonna need a new spot.
Tight on Murphy.
MURPHY Roger that.
He turns behind him giving that 50 ft. cliff a second look.
The Taliban gunfire is relentless now. Coming from all three sides.
Luttrell, Danny and Axe returning constant fire. Reloading mags. Firing away. Marcus hit for the first time in his right ass cheek.
Tight on Murphy:
MURPHY (CONT’D) We gotta fall back.
Luttrell looks at the cliff behind them.
LUTTRELL You mean fall off.
67.
MURPHY
Roger that. Fall off. Danny can you
move?
DANNY No problem.
Axe?
MURPHY
AXE Good to go.
As the four shot up SEALs turn and start to move fast towards the edge of the cliff. The pitch causing them to run and start falling immediately. Danny’s legs giving out, buckling as he hurls himself up and over the ledge.
Marcus turns to Murphy.
Luttrell, Murphy and Axe do the same. For a second they look like four country boys cliff jumping into a lake. Except for the blood streaming from necks and guts and legs, the bullet tracers flying all around them...
They fly off the cliff and it looks kind of beautiful. Freeing...until.
48A IMPACT. BOTTOM OF 1ST CLIFF 48A
Bone crushing. Concussive. Violent beyond words. Human bodies smashing into rock. Tearing through trees. Bouncing. Broken bones and smashed faces. Helmets fly off. The SEALs crash and bounce and flip. Finally settling hard on a reasonably flat part of the cliff. 300 yards below.
48B SILENCE. BOTTOM OF 1ST CLIFF 48B
Tight on Luttrell. Face down. The first to move.
Face lifts. Nose clearly broken. Luttrell looks to his left.
Murphy struggling to his knees. Broken teeth. Face shredded. To the right, Danny and Axe.
MURPHY Hey Marcus.
LUTTRELL Yes sir.
MURPHY That sucked.
68.
LUTTRELL Yes sir.
MURPHY
I mean that really sucked.
LUTTRELL Yes sir.
Voices screaming up the mountain.
48C TOP OF 1ST CLIFF 48C
Taraq is at the jump point looking down the steep cliff. Feels unsurvivable. Several fierce lieutenants flanking Shah.
Go.
SHAH
Dozens of Taliban start making their way down the steep cliff.
48D AT THE BOTTOM OF 1ST CLIFF 48D Murphy, Marcus Axe and Dietz struggling to their feet.
MURPHY
Fuck.
Luttrell sees the blood pouring from Murphy’s gut.
LUTTRELL Let me see it.
Pulling up Murphy’s shirt revealing a decent gut shot. Marcus looks for his med kit.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) Lost my med kit.
MURPHY Where’s your gun?
Luttrell looks down. To his left, then right. Spots his gun ten feet away in the dirt.
69.
LUTTRELL
God’s looking out for us.
MURPHY
If this is looking out for us I
don’t want to see him pissed.
LUTTRELL
We’re doing good Mikey we just
gotta...
Luttrell interrupted by a series of severe incoming RPG’s. Blasting all around them.
Luttrell and Murphy dive behind some fallen trees. Looking up.
MURPHY
We just got to get off this hill.
48E HALFWAY DOWN 1ST CLIFF. 48E
Shah’s Taliban are slowly moving down the cliff. Not nearly as fast as the SEALs fall. But they are definitely coming.
48F ON LUTTRELL and MURPHY. LOG HIDE. 48F

This is all very silent. Tense....Taraq like a hunting dog, dead quiet, Luttrell and Axe, the hunted, desperately trying to stay quiet.
On Luttrell - trying to move towards a large rock...
His right foot digging in for traction, dislodges a small pebble... on that pebble picking up momentum, hitting smaller pebbles, dislodging more little rocks... A mini avalanche, hitting a bigger rock.
Tight on Luttrell.
Looking down at the small rock slide, hearing its noise....
Shit.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D)
And they open fire again, bullets firing all around Luttrell, both Luttrell and Axe return fire. This is much closer gun fighting...grenades and RPG’s at close quarters. Men behind rocks, guns blazing.

The second 47 pulls up over the LZ.
Ramp down, fast rope out. The SEALs, lead by Kristensen, up ready to fast rope out....
The TF 160 gunners alert, scanning behind their 50 Cal. Machine guns.
The 47 pulls up, high hover, 80 ft. drop. Tight on Kristensen
His hands around the fast rope....
KRISTENSEN
Let’s do this. Patton, you’re first

Shane Patton, can’t help but grin, he’s on his feet moving towards the open door.
You good?
KRISTENSEN (CONT’D)
SHANE PATTON Couldn’t be more good.
KRISTENSEN
Glorious opportunity here, Mr.
Patton.
SHANE PATTON
Yes sir.
Kristensen has one foot out of the chopper when... Movement on the ground.
50 Cal gunner catches the reflection of something metallic, a small detonation from the ground. Then terrifying sights of incoming ordinance.
RPG!
50 CAL GUNNER
Tight on Kristensen and Patton looking down as the RPG round flies into the chopper right past them, literally into the 47.
99.
74 EXT. A MOMENT OF SILENCE, THEN... 74 The Chinook explodes.
Ripping apart, tilting, rotor blades immediately tearing into treetops then thick tree trunks - like massive buzz saws - the chopper turns and burns.
99A.
Rocks and trees churn, bodies break and burn and die as the big Chinook 47 rips apart exploding and tumbling down the mountain.
DOWN RANGE:
74A ON LUTTRELL - peering up at the explosion. 74A
Luttrell watches wide-eyed as his teammates smash and burn.

75 INT. 47 - AIRBORNE 75 Argument breaking out between SEAL Lt. and Airforce Pilot.
SEAL LT.
You got to put us down now!
PILOT No fucking way.
Now!
SEAL LT.
As the SEALs on the chopper start breaking out the windows firing their M-4’s out the window, Airforce gunmen open up the 50 cals. Massive fire power blasting out from the choppers.
76 MOUNTAIN ABOVE VILLAGE - LATE DAY 76
Marcus looking cross mountain at Axe who has managed to transverse one hundred feet of the mountain and is leading a small pack of Shah’s men away from Luttrell.
Axe starts taking heavy fire. Shot twice through the throat. Falling backwards. Trying to get up. Back to his weapon.
AXE DYING.
Marcus watching helpless from across the mountain. Trying to cover Axe as the Taliban move in on him.
Not all of them have followed Axe because as Marcus turns back an RPG blows ten feet in front of him. Shrapnel and rock smashing into the side of his head.
His Helmet tears off his head.
100.
Tight on Marcus rolling backwards. Falling. Tumbling further down the mountain.
Tight on his helmet, Texas flag painted bold across it. Rolling and smashing down the mountain.
He comes to a hard stop slamming the back of his exposed head into a rock.
Tight on Marcus. Close to unconscious. Very dazed, Very confused.
MARCUS POV.

Taraq and his men hear the incoming Apaches.

83B DOWN HILL: 83B
Marcus deaf to the incoming Apaches. Has no idea how close they are. As he falls, gets up, off balance stumbles off a 30 ft drop.
This time not so lucky with his landing, comes down hard, shatters his right shin, bone tears through his skin, compound fracture.
Screaming in pain, Luttrell crawls into a rock crevasse. Hiding, he attempts to clear his head.
We play all of Luttrell’s audio perspective here as deaf. Abstract surges of sound. He’s basically deaf.
The Apaches fly high over head. Missing Luttrell. Disappearing over mountain tops as they keep moving to avoid enemy ground fire.
Struggling to silence his hysterical breathing, Luttrell hides as Taraq and his men move all around him. Luttrell sees shadows of the fighters. He silently starts covering himself with rocks and dirt.
Luttrell well hidden.
We slowly push in on him as his head starts to nod forward. He lifts it. Fighting the powerful urge for sleep. It falls again. He lifts it. Leaning his head back against the crevasse wall.
Taraq and his men back on the hunt. Searching rock to rock.
Tight on Luttrell. Head back. Breathing slower. As Luttrell falls to sleep.
FADE TO BLACK.

84 INT. LUTTRELL’S HIDE 84
TIGHT ON MARCUS. Looks DEAD. EYES TWITCH. SLOWLY OPEN. LUTTRELL wakes up.
Disoriented. First thing he notices is the bird sitting up on a rock above him. He hears it. Sort of. Faded. Loud then silent. His hearing has partially returned.
LUTTRELL very slowly clears himself from the dirt and rock hide.
Inventories himself, his weapons.
Two magazines, two grenades. No food. No water.
Bleeding has stopped from his gunshot. Leg is fucked up. Shin bone busting out.
Luttrell sits down. Examining his leg. Probing the bone. Rips off his pants exposing his broken leg in UA shorts. Tears welling he bites down on his lips as he resets the broken bone. Jamming it back inside his skin.
Tucking back the bone.
Luttrell packs the puncture wound with dirt. Starts massaging his dead legs. Forcing blood back into them. Deep powerful breathing as he starts to will his body back into life.
104.
85 EXT. LUTTRELL’S HIDE 85
Luttrell slowly moves out of the hide scanning the area for any sign of Taraq or Shah.
Luttrell sees nothing.
The village is close. Couple of hundred yards.
LUTTRELL moves out. Slowly picking his way down towards the village.
At fifty yards Luttrell pulls up. Takes cover behind some rocks. Stares down at the village through his M4 scope.

Male, large and powerful.
The wolf studies Luttrell.

Luttrell picks himself up.
Studies the wolf closely.
Water drips off the side of the Wolf’s face. His coat seems wet.
Luttrell turns. Listens.
HEARS the SOUND of falling water.
TRACK with Luttrell towards the sound of the water.
Luttrell moves to 20 ft. waterfall, pouring into a beautiful clear pool of crystal clear fresh water.
Luttrell tries to slide down the steep cliff sides of the water pool.
Too excited, moving too fast, Luttrell slips, falling, tumbling. He falls fast into the water.
UNDERWATER.
Luttrell cuts through the water. Like a baptism as the cool water surrounds him. Luttrell stays under water. Eyes closed. Feeling it.
Finally comes up.
SURFACES.
Swims to the shore on his hands and knees.
LUTTRELL drinks. And drinks......
Slurping like a broken animal.
Grabbing for hunks of water plants. Luttrell eats. Shoving the plants into his mouth. Desperate for any kind of energy.

Finally one of the Afghans. A 30 year old male GULAB, the leader, strong rugged handsome, steps forward. Hands up in peace.
GULAB Not Taliban.
Luttrell studies Gulab. Looks deep into his eyes.
Luttrell looks from Gulab to the other Afghan men. Their faces seem kind. Nothing like the death looks we have seen from the Taliban.

Gulab slowly stepping to and reaching for Luttrell. Voices heard from deeper into the woods.
Taraq and his crew getting closer.
One of Gulab’s men says something quiet to Gulab.

Armed grenade in one hand, Luttrell slowly reaches his right bleeding hand out.
Tight on two hands grabbing each other.
As they pull him up, out of the stream, voices of Taraq and his men suddenly much closer.
Gulab whispers something to one of his men.
Luttrell is quickly pushed down into a crevasse between two rocks.
A young Afghan boy sits on top of Luttrell hiding him further.
Luttrell eyes wide, clutching his grenade.
The young boy gently patting Luttrell’s back, trying to calm him.

Punk Rock Lyrics

I've heard, I've read all kinds of reviews—
Well, I'll tell you about punk rock
Punk rock is a word used by dilettantes and, uh, and, uh, heartless manipulators about music
That takes up the energies and the bodies and the hearts and the souls and the time and the minds of young men who give what they have to it and give everything they have to it
And it's a, it's a term that's based on contempt, it's a term that's based on fashion, style, elitism, Satanism, and everything that's rotten about rock and roll
I don't know Johnny Rotten, but I'm sure, I'm sure he puts as much blood and sweat into what he does as Sigmund Freud did
You see, what, what sounds to you like a big load of trashy old noise is in fact the brilliant music of a genius, myself
And that music is so powerful that it's quite beyond my control and, uh, when I'm in the grips of it I don't feel pleasure and I don't feel pain, either physically or emotionally
Do you understand what I'm talking about?
Have you ever, have you ever felt like that?
When you just, when you just, you couldn't feel anything and you didn't want to either
You know? Like that
Some critics—
Do you understand what I'm saying, sir?",https://genius.com/Mogwai-punk-rock-lyrics,"I've heard, I've read all kinds of reviews—

Rise crystal spear, fly true over me
Suddenly gone from here, left alone on the road
What brings you back?

Of home, of home

So much fun hanging around in the dark

Managed to somehow find a way out of here
Dagger in everyone's heart

Are you still into it? 'Cause I'm still into it

Am I your only one? 'Cause you're still my only one
But if you need more, I'll just do it in some, right

We should go into town and spend some money
We could go to the pictures and see something funny
We'd share a popcorn and we can go to the pub at night
We can get right tanked up and go home and have a fight

Will you still miss me when I'm gone?
Is there love there, even when I'm wrong?
Will you still kiss me if you find out?
I will now leave you, but don't follow me

Yes! I Am a Long Way from Home Lyrics

'Cause this music can put a human being in a trance-like state and deprive it for the sneaking feeling of existing
'Cause music is bigger than words and wider than pictures
If someone said that Mogwai are the stars, I would not object
If the stars had a sound, it would sound like this
The punishment for these solemn words can be hard
Can blood boil like this at the sound of a noisy tape that I've heard?
I know one thing
On Saturday, the sky will crumble together or something, with a huge bang to fit into the cave


What? start speaking now?
When I shag a bird you'd think Antarctica had defrosted on her bed
Sometimes when I'm puffing hash I get a bird to suck my dong
Often when I don't clean my knob I get my sister to lick the cheese off my helmet

Repelish Lyrics
The only song on Rave Tapes to have anything close to lyrics.

The lyrics of this song are originally from a Christian radio broadcast from 1981 discussing the alleged use of subliminal “backmasked” messages…

""Further in the tape, I came across another part, that made me throw my headphones right off my head. I couldn't believe what I've heard.
 
Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway To Heaven,"" again, was voted the most popular tune of rock's history.
 Keep that in mind as I show this taped excerpt with you. In the lyrics of the song, they sing, ""The piper is calling you to join him... She's 
buying
 her stairway to Heaven,"" we know that's not possible
This is where the subliminal message comes in that we've been talking about in the previous interview. 
The subliminal message is a Satanic message, that was put on their record in reverse
The needle'll go in the opposite direction. You say that I've never heard anything like that before. Probably not, but many, many people have.
 And this is what I'm talking about, you can only hear it a few more minutes
They sing backwards, in human voices. Satan. You gotta live for Satan. Master Satan. The message that they have altogether, that they wanted you to hear, in subliminal way, or in reverse, is this
Because I live, surely, there's no escaping it. Satan. We gotta live for Satan
You've heard of group after group who worship his singing, for Satan, they know He is real. God tells us He's not willing that any should perish, and that includes Mick Jagger and Alice Cooper, and all of the rock singers. Because they have a choice to make. What about you? What do you choose?""",https://genius.com/Mogwai-repelish-lyrics,"buying

What Are They Doing in Heaven Today? Lyrics

What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow have all gone away
Peace abounds like a river they say
What are they doing there now?

I'm thinking of friends that I used to know
Who lived and suffered in this world below
But they're gone off to heaven, but I want to know
What are they doing there now?

What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow have all gone away
Peace abounds like a river they say
What are they doing there now?

There's some whose hearts were burdened with care
They pay for their moment with fighting and tears
But they clung to the cross with trembling and fear
What are they doing there now?

What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow have all gone away
Peace abounds like a river they say
What are they doing there now?


And there's some whose bodies were full of disease
Physicians and doctors couldn't give them much ease
But they suffered 'til death brought a final release
But what are they doing there now?

What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow have all gone away
Peace abounds like a river they say
What are they doing there now?

There's some who were poor and often despised
They looked up toward heaven with tear-blinded eyes
While people heedless and deaf to their cries
What are they doing there now?

We’re Not Done (End Title) Lyrics
Holding back the fear again
Try to make it real again
Fight against the past
Hide away from everything
Under static sentiment
We can make it last
Love inside of me
Another kind of life
Standing on the ice
Where are you now
Open my eyes
For the final time
For the final time
So glad to see you my friend
Hold on to the space again
Everything unfolds
Possibly another way
Thinking of you every day
We are going home
Love inside of me
Another kind of life
Standing on the ice

The car's on fire and there's no driver at the wheel
And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides
And a dark wind blows
The government is corrupt
And we're on so many drugs
With the radio on and the curtains drawn
We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine
And the machine is bleeding to death
The sun has fallen down
And the billboards are all leering
And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles
It went like this:
The buildings toppled in on themselves
Mothers clutching babies
Picked through the rubble
And pulled out their hair
The skyline was beautiful on fire
All twisted metal stretching upwards
Everything washed in a thin orange haze

I said, ""
Kiss me, you're beautiful
These are truly the last days""
You grabbed my hand
And we fell into it
Like a daydream
Or a fever
We woke up one morning and fell a little further down
For sure as the valley of death
I open up my wallet
And it's full of blood

...prepared in innocence to meet our king of glory
And so we have this
You have it in your secret windows
And you're understanding to understand it and to bring it forth
It takes minute detail
It takes a holy life
It takes motions
It takes dedication
It takes dedication
It takes a death
And only God can allow it
And you couldn't do it if you're not the seed of God
And so the path through the great corridors
These are corridors unto his perfection
That is which the prophet and the Urim and Thummim has penetrated
That through this great sea of blackness
That I penetrated through these corridors
And I went through that last segment
Where I went through these dark serpentines
I passed through that corridor
Where they sat, where they are
And when you penetrate to the most high God
You will believe you are mad
You will believe you've gone insane
But I tell you if you follow the secret window
And you die to the ego nature
You will penetrate this darkness
Oh yes, there's many a man or woman
That's been put in the insane asylum
When this has happened to them
And they're sitting there today, people think they're insane
But they saw something that's real
And they see it when they're on drugs
The only thing is they see it
Not through the light of God, and the way I show you
I show you to see it through the light of God
And the understanding of God
Because when you see the face of God, you will die
And there will be nothing left of you
Except the God-man, the God-woman
The heavenly man, the heavenly woman
The heavenly child
There'll be prayer on your lips day and night
There'll be a song of jubilee waiting for your king
There will be nothing you will look--be looking for in this world
Excepting for your god
This is all a dream
A dream in death

And so I went through that with you
I encountered Hell and the great serpentines of the highest order
And I went through that when I showed you chart #3
The question is asked in Urim and Thummim--Thummim concerning the pit
This horrible pit of miry clay
Urim and Thummim
You can ask me a question
If it's asked, from the right being or the right soul
Out of Urim and Thummim
I can give you unspoken words that's never been spoken
It's not even in your Bible
Yet, it does clarify what is spoken in the Bible...

God love this country, the United States, the world
And all the billionaires
If money could buy happiness, my love, then we'll have it
But praise God
It's only salvation, it's only Jesus Christ
Holy Hallelujah, holy Jesus Christ (
Nah, I'm not up for this
)
God give us peace, happiness, and love (
I believe in Jesus!
)
And joy in our souls
No matter what we have, no matter the money
No matter the riches of the world
It cannot buy, it cannot buy what we want—
Thank you
But the price of not realizing what we want
And what we need is the love of Jesus Christ
With the love of Jesus Christ
Hallelujah
I don't care what you have in the world
For if you don't have Jesus then we'd all be lost
We don't have the happiness and joy
If we don't have Jesus Christ, we don't have nothing
Nothing is alright in our life
Nothing-nothing, nothing-nothing
If we don't have Jesus in our life

You think the end of the world is coming?

The preacher man says it's the end of time
He says that America's rivers are going dry
The interest is up, the stock market's down
You guys gotta be careful walking around here this late at night

Spare change? Spare change?

This— no we don't, ma'am, I'm sorry
This— This— This is the perfect place to get jumped

But do you think the end of the world is coming?

No
So says the preacher man, but
I don't go by what he says


Indeed



Deliver us from the gathering storm
Unworthy though we are
Leave us living safe and warm
And sheltered in your arms
Fallen out of grace are we
Sinless never more to be
Deliver us from the gathering storm
Unworthy though we are
Deliver us from the shadows and fear
And brighten us our night
O lift us out of the valley of sin
And leave our path in light

Interviewer
: Well... Where are you coming from?
Blaise Bailey Finnegan III
: (pause) Well... I don't like the way the country's ran, don't you know, and, erm... that's pretty much what I was expressing in my poem. The government... the American government - they're sneaky, they're very deceitful, they're liars, they're cheats, they're rip-offs. I mean, the American government is one-- is one systematic government that... that nobody can trust. I don't trust them myself
Interviewer
: And how long have you been writing for?
Blaise Bailey Finnegan III
: Huh?
Interviewer
: How long have you been writing for?
Blaise Bailey Finnegan III
: Since I was four
Interviewer
: Do you do this sort of thing a lot, like, open-mic kinda questions?
Blaise Bailey Finnegan III
: Oh, I love open-mics, I love coming here to do open-mics, absolutely
Interviewer
: What kind of reactions do you usually get?
Blaise Bailey Finnegan III
: Usually, people are... are pretty much in agreement with what I'm saying
Interviewer
: We overheard you before talking about... you went to court today for a speeding ticket?
Blaise Bailey Finnegan III
: That's accurate
Interviewer
: right. Do you wanna tell us that story?

Blaise Bailey Finnegan III
: Yes, absolutely, I wouldn't mind telling you the story. Erm... I went to court today for a speeding ticket, and I told the judge, erm... ""Let me tell you something, and you listen and you listen good, I'm only gonna say this one time and one time only, I don't repeat myself for nobody,"" I said. I says... ""I'm here to pay a speeding ticket, not to listen to your lectures and hear you run your mouth for an hour."" I says ""I'm here to pay off my speeding ticket... and I'm here to... to get my fines out of the way and get the fuck to work."" The judge says ""You can't talk like that in my courtroom, you're in contempt of court."" Then I said... I told the judge, ""If that's the best you can do, I feel sorry for you."" I said ""Why don't you just shut your fucking mouth for once and listen."" I said ""I'm not gonna take your shit."" I said ""I'm gonna pay my speeding ticket like I said."" I walked up to the god damn judge and I hand him my 25 dollars and I says ""Here's my money, now I am leaving."" And I left it at that
Then, before I left, I turned around and told the judge ""I'm here to state who I am and be honest with you."" I said ""If they thought I was dangerous on the road like you're trying to accuse me of, wouldn't they have taken my license when I first got it? Yes they would."" And the judge says ""Yeah, you have a point,"" He goes ""You don't need to get loud,"" I said ""Don't get loud?"" I says ""I've got every right to get loud."" I says ""You can't do a god damn thing about it, because I'm expressing myself in your court, and there is nothing you can do about it. You think you're god because you have a robe and 
you can put people up the goddamn river
 for 20 years? Well you're not."" And I left it at that
Interviewer
: Did you walk away?
Blaise Bailey Finnegan III
: Yes I did. I don't like the judicial system, I don't like the government system, I don't like the police, I don't like anything to do with this country's government. I just don't like it, because... they're sneaky, like I said - they're deceitful, they're lying, they're cheats, they rip the people off. That's the American government for you. America is a third world country, and people don't recognise it... and I think that that's pretty god damn sad, that they don't recognise their own country as a third world, third rate, third class slum

Interviewer
: Well... Do you have any weapons?
Blaise Bailey Finnegan III
: Yes, I do. I own a high-powered assault rifle, I own a 12-gauge double barrel shotgun, I own a regular shotgun, I own a regular hunting rifle, I own a 9mm, a 357, a 45 handgun, a 38 special, and, erm... I own an m-16 fully automatic ground assault rifle...
Interviewer
: Do you think things are gonna get better before they get worse?
Blaise Bailey Finnegan III
: No way. Things are just gonna get worse and keep on getting worse. Like I said, America's a third world country as it is and... and we're just basically in a hopeless situation as it stands
Interviewer
: What do you think this country's gonna look like in the year 2003?
Blaise Bailey Finnegan III
: Y'know, I'll tell you the truth - nothing against you guys, but I don't wanna answer that question because... I haven't even got a mind that's that...that inhumane
Interviewer
: are you ready for what's coming?
Blaise Bailey Finnegan III
: Ready as I'll ever be
Interviewer
: Most people aren't

Blaise Bailey Finnegan III
: There's a little saying... Dates back for generations...
Interviewer
: Go on...
Blaise Bailey Finnegan III
: Be prepared for anything at any time from anybody, don't take no shit, always stand your ground. People wanna come up to me and run their mouth - guess what? I'll throw them through the fucking window... I won't think a thing of it
Interviewer
: Would you mind reciting your poem for us?
Blaise Bailey Finnegan III
: Not at all, I don't see why... I don't see why I couldn't
There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind
It's not state of the art, it's a serious state of the mind
The muggers, the backstabbers, the two faced elite
A menace to society, a social disease
To brainwash the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order
Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating and sneering at life's disarray
Eating away at your own self esteem
Pouncing on every word that you might be saying
To attack someone's mind is a social disorder
The constitution, the government, martial law order
Superficially smiling a shake of the hand
As soon as your back is turned treason is planned

When every good thing's laid to rest
By the governments hate, by the constitution and their lies
And every time you think you're safe
And when you go to turn away
You know they're sharpening all their knives
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it
Without a conscience they destroy
And that's a thing that they enjoy
They're a sickness that's in all of our minds
They want to sink the ship and leave
The way they laugh at you and me
You know it happens all the time
But it only happens in your mind
The rats in the cellar you know who you are...
Or do you?
Watching beginnings of social decay

: ""The Dead Flag Blues (Intro)""]
The car's on fire and there's no driver at the wheel
And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides
And a dark wind blows
The government is corrupt
And we're on so many drugs
With the radio on and the curtains drawn
We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine
And the machine is bleeding to death
The sun has fallen down
And the billboards are all leering
And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles
It went like this:
The buildings tumbled in on themselves
Mothers clutching babies
Picked through the rubble
And pulled out their hair
The skyline was beautiful on fire
All twisted metal stretching upwards
Everything washed in a thin orange haze

I said: ""Kiss me, you're beautiful -
These are truly the last days""
You grabbed my hand
And we fell into it
Like a daydream
Or a fever
We woke up one morning and fell a little further down -
For sure it's the valley of death
I open up my wallet
And it's full of blood

(0:00-6:09)
: ""The Dead Flag Blues (Intro)""]
And a dark wind blows
The government is corrupt
And we're on so many drugs
With the radio on and the curtains drawn
We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine
And the machine is bleeding to death
The sun has fallen down
And the billboards are all leering
It went like this:
The buildings tumbled in on themselves
Mothers clutching babies
Picked through the rubble
And pulled out their hair
The skyline was beautiful on fire
All twisted metal stretching upwards
Everything washed in a thin orange haze
I said: ""Kiss me, you're beautiful -
These are truly the last days""
You grabbed my hand
And we fell into it
Like a daydream
Or a fever
For sure it's the valley of death
I open up my wallet
And it's full of blood

RAINDROPS CAST IN LEAD Lyrics
Gotas de lluvia fundidas en plomo
Nuestro lado iluminado
Y luego apagado y enterrado y terminado
Debajo del sol perfecto
Debajo del cuerpo cayendo del cielo
Fueron mártires que cayeron
Porque en nuestro lado son mártires desde antes que siquiera hubiéramos nacido
Las que trataron y fueron asesinadas por tratar
Las que murieron jóvenes, enfurecidas o viejas, y nunca vieron el amanecer
Inocentes y niños y los pequeñitos cuerpos que rieron y luego quedaron dormidos para siempre
Y nunca vieron la belleza del amanecer",https://genius.com/Godspeed-you-black-emperor-raindrops-cast-in-lead-lyrics,"English

I think you'll notice when things become different
The good vibes in our lives won't feel so consistent
And less becomes more 'cause the weight is too heavy
I swim in the water that's breaking your levee

The way that you left me is alright, it's alright
If I argue the point then we yell and we fight
And I won't be home for the rest of the night
You might hate my words but you know that I'm right
You know that I'm right

This is your life, there's no way to run from it
The doubt in your brain or the pain in your stomach
I only have but one complaint at the moment
Don't paint me black when I used to be golden

The way that you left me is alright, it's alright
If I argue the point then we yell and we fight
And I won't be home for the rest of the night

Hard shove, feel the heavy weight
It's the same love that I push away
It be the same thing I always debate
Why you left me here for another
These days I tend to see red
'Cause all the women swimming in my head
Are not the same ones laying in my bed
But I do my best to ignore it

But you still come up
You still come up

It's all in my head, there's not much I can do
You set your pace, I'll keep mine too
Each time I chase, I feel dark blue
Confuse your face for someone new

I guess I owe you for most everything
Like the way I feel and the curse you bring
You got a lot of nerve to wanna hear me sing
After you tossed us into the gutter
Mad now like I was before
'Cause somebody's always asking who I do it for
But I don't wanna do it for you anymore
I do my best to ignore it


But you still come up
You still come up

It's all in my head, there's not much I can do
You set your pace, I'll keep mine too
Each time I chase, I feel dark blue
Confuse your face for someone new

Yeah I should let you go
Away from the grey that we both know
And I can't pass through Indio
Without feeling indigo
Yeah I should let this go
But it gets so hectic on my own
You can't be proud if I'm alone

24, staring in your face like it’s the front of the door
I know right now is hard 'cause this all feels like a chore
I don’t want this as a job help me find something more
I cannot tell the ceiling from the floor
Is this really what you want?
Swear I never meant to haunt
All I ever do is taunt
Couldn’t handle how you flaunt
Now it’s quiet on the front
Has been for so many months
Now it’s wild to remember I was in love with you once

It's all love now, upside down
It's all love now, upside down

Let me go, cut the leash before
I lose us in a bad undertow
Have to channel how you made me feel
To play every show
Make my snide suggestions about
The things I don’t know
I will not catch a feeling I’ll just float
All that time across the pond
All this resin in my lungs
No more room to shoulder on
Am I even having fun?
Colin’s sleeping with his gun
Scott is looking for the one
Mertz is going by Ryan now that we’ve all had our run


It's all love now, upside down
It's all love now, upside down

Carry baggage I can't put down
Every show, every night, every town

Navy Blue Lyrics

I bet it hurts to read ""permanence""
I used to think on all of this
And how you don't
Damn, it's hard to find sustenance
When all I had was love for this
And now you don't
Now I just abuse substances
To drown out your accomplishments
However few

All of this frustrates me bad
'Cause I can't stay mad
At you or change anything that I had
She told me, ""Don't think like that
It's really not that bad""
I hope this makes you sad
I hope this makes you sad

If it's something serious then hit me up
But until then, the door is shut
Forget my room
And if I had a match for every lie
And every attempt to deny
I'd strike a few
I am the walls, the silent halls
My jacket at your sister's wedding

Take Me as You Please Lyrics

Don't leave my light on
You'll burn out the bulb
And then I'll have to buy another
It's not like we can't talk to each other
Don't write a sad song
You'll burn out your love
And then you'll have to find another
I’m gonna shine on for my little brother

Hazy, lazy
Burning through my trees
She says that I'm crazy
But I don't let it faze me
Taste me, baby
Take me as you please
Take me as you please

I feel the sunshine
That burns away the cold
Pulling off the nylon cover
How many times can I say that I love her?
That's not for this song
'Cause I'm done with all the noise
Know that we can talk to each other
It's all good, it's all love, now it's over

Leaning on a bad knee
Don't really wanna be with anyone
Can you hear in my key?
How can you not see it's not always fun?
Wait, score, speed back, lock the door, just pour
I'm gettin' numb
Not enough, gimme more soda
Soaking through the floor of 51

My appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it
I can't believe you're still upset, get over it
And leave me alone
My appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it
I can't believe you're still upset, get over it
And leave me alone

Glue me into my seat
Spill onto my feet and let it run
'Cause I am all that you need
The hunger I feed, my loaded gun
Always sore in my back from the spine that I lack to really be done
That's enough, no more
I'm barely breathing anymore


Ask me how did I let this get worse?
Dove through the mud for my verse
Tell me, how many wounds can you nurse?
Dive into nothing head first

My appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it
I can't believe you're still upset, get over it
And leave me alone
My appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it
I can't believe you're still upset, get over it
And leave me alone

Highs and lows are how I flow
My favorite mirror's there
Wanna look at what I think I know
But all I do is stare
Too long
I defy the proper dose 'cause I'm alone and I don't care
And though that grass is greener it just don't even compare
At all, at all

All this time I wanna give you back
I feel opaque and absentee
Am I just going through the motions
Or is this how I'll be?
Barely focused anymore
The haze is all that I can see
Red bottle, white cap

Slime in my stomach slowly turning
Staring at the grout in the tile
Dry is my heave and my head is burning
Think I'll be in here a while,
 I'm gone
And my cousin's age is turning
Growing into a man from a child
I wanna watch him play, wanna see him score
Wanna be around cause I need
To make him smile some more


All this time I wanna give you back

When you're up north, the ice is slick like my voice
She's like, ""I never left you, this was all your choice""
I can't doubt it now, I might lose all my poise
When I mislead you on purpose, fade into the void
Feeling indigo
How 'bout you?
I feel indigo

And I wish you'd just call, and we could hash it out
I could tell you what I'm so mad about
Bet you're sick of hearin' me sulk and pout
Had so much on my mind 'til now
Like when we gonna do this? The where and how?
And if I see you, am I gonna curse you out?
Is it enough that I'm up right now?
Does it anger you that I chose a different route?

'Cause I'm sick of feeling that I'm late
Tired of having to restate: ""I can't just sit around and wait
You're just not someone I can date""
Now look who can't hold their weight
I hope I'm wrong just for your sake
Using pills and flowers to sedate
Find me, heal me, keep my faith


You have to know every place I go
That feeling stuck that I offered trust and it left me solo
And if I haven't grown from every face I've known
Is it all for naught? Is that food for thought?
Yeah, there's things you don't know

'Cause I'm sick of feeling that I'm late
Tired of having to restate: ""I can't just sit around and wait

High Regard Lyrics

Barter and trade, always passive-aggressive
In spite of who you say you are
Smother my name under soil and dirt in the earth
Widen the distance apart
Fuck an apology, I'm not sorry for anything
I've been holding back my apathy for far too long
You don't deserve what you haven't earned
And your place in my heart has just grown so small

I'd like to think that you're worth my time
But you embody everything that I hate
Take a good hard look at what you see
I've lost all my hope and all my faith
'Cause when I barely fuck up, you just recoil and weep
What do you want from me? I'm just a kid who got in too deep
My walls are built up high, forever bound to be steep
I've got a birds' eye view of all the secrets you keep

Try to tell me that you knew from the start
That I would come to know that most would never enter my heart
Because I'm colder than the others, it's what sets me apart
You manipulate and try to shine a light on my dark
But this is my life, you should bounce & never call again
No more strife, go find it in the souls of the other men
You know you're not as smart as you look
I'm gonna take back what you took


You know you're not as smart as you look
I'm going to take back what you took
And you didn't know shit from the start
And you didn't know shit from the start",https://genius.com/The-story-so-far-high-regard-lyrics,"Barter and trade, always passive-aggressive

Chase me
Fill in the gap now
Gold in my iris
I miss how the waves sound
I haven't talked to my brother in over a year now
I hope that he's still proud

What's with the things I do?
To try to disconnect you two
Tore all the fabric from our loom
And I hate that
My pessimistic views stem from all the drugs I use
Hide all my guilt inside this bruise
It's my ruse

Phase me, I feel the distance

If I Fall Lyrics

Clear your head, so self-centered
Yet you're very well read
Leave your bed, all that oil gonna kill you dead
Got my check, lost my center in a deep mud debt
I know you're upset I'll stop it, I'll quit

My choices let down some of my closest people
But I'm gaining back ground
And forcing myself to get better by Fall
Will you be there if I fall?

I never seem to have it in line
I don't think you've ever seen me fine
Give me space, make me pace, let me whine
Saving face at the cost of what I owe
Getting big, watch the clock where'd the time go
Cut it short when I'm scared of what I can't grow
All these loose ends that I can't sew
What do I care, what do you know?

My choices let down some of my closest people
But I'm gaining back ground
And forcing myself to get better by Fall
My choices let down some of my closest people
But I'm gaining back ground
Forcing myself to get better by Fall
Will you be there if I fall?


I'm sick of all the wack shit you're getting into
Think I'll bounce, I gotta go
I'm stuck inside a place where I can't love you
You feel the vibe, I think you know
There's not a single place that I can go to
Without noise that I chose
I'm stuck inside and my stomach's throwing up now
From yellow pills and purple glow

Empty Space Lyrics

All that I know is your space is empty
It's buried below, the stress and the envy
All the places I go, it still hasn’t left me
I hated it then, 
and now it consumes me

I dwell on it nightly, tread swiftly and lightly
Make up the lost ground and see what you don't see
All the questions aside, I asked and you lied
And now my hands are tied

All I can show is absence from your life
That I can’t control, 
it’s all that I get right
Keep paying the toll, 
I know that it seems like
I’m always upset, I know it seems like I'm always upset

(I know it seems like I'm always upset)

It’s buried below, it still hasn’t left me

Roam Lyrics

Give up and go home
Alone, and suffer some more
This head of stone lets no one in anymore
Cause my effort is never enough
I'll start unpacking all of my stuff
Cause I've come to know my place
So let's wreck everything I've built except the base

You have no idea how unproductive it is
To fall in and out of you as often as I do
And lately I've been feeling grey but today
I'm alright no thanks to you

Think I'll go and roam outside your boundary
Walk on the ridge. Far away from the city
Friends of friends prove untrustworthy
Be gone, just like you were at the last party
No SOS until the bottles are empty

Now my hunger isn't wasted anymore
Cause I'm younger but I'm tired and I'm sore
I know where you've been
You’re ruining men
Never again will I let someone in
I know where you've been
You’re ruining men
Never again will I let someone in

Everything about you is somebody else
You're a product of environment and middle-class wealth
And sleeping that much won't improve your health
Your interest in me is like dust on the shelf
 (Dust on the shelf)
Easy to brush off despite your mood
Call me a liar, I'll show you a fake
My old man told me to think on my own
And I'm sure that's your biggest mistake

Watch the sunrise over Mt. Diablo
If you even bother getting dressed today
You'll avert your eyes, neglect the skies
I hate it when you act that way
I miss the old you, the one I used to talk to
The one who kept her judgments at bay, 
tell me

Will I ever see you again? Will I ever see you?
And if you cut out scheduled time, you'll find piece of mind
Trust me, it's worth your weight in gold
And if you think you're fine, go ahead, follow that line
At least none of my friends do what they're told
By what they're sold


Do you look yourself straight in the eyes
And think about who you let between your thighs?
Cut the shit, be real with me
You're the only one I ever fucking judge
The one who came to school every day
Woke up for the world, practiced honesty
Her business was hers

Will I ever see you again?

Things I Can’t Change Lyrics

This twitch in my fingers
Love/hate, it lingers
Sent it direct but the point must have missed her
Gave up and lost 'cause of timing and pressure
And now I'm gone

Lie alone, it's all you can do now
And hear me drone about the things I can't change
Lie alone, it's all you can do now
And hear me, hear me drone on my own

What has this come to?
I know you don't see me as much you ought to
And both wounds are bleeding out
Grace me with nothing but patience
I'll admit that I hate this if there's no other way out
There's no other way out

Lie alone, it's all you can do now
And hear me drone about the things I can't change
Lie alone, it's all you can do now
And hear me, hear me drone on my own


On the outs with everything

[Verse 1: Fil Thorpe-Evans, 
Ben Barlow
]
Take it slow
Tell me all how you've grown, just for me
Could we all reminisce?
Better yet, here's a pen
Make a list
Fill it full with all the things I've missed
'Cause I could barely drive past the school
Without stopping to think of you
And how we used to act the fool
But worst of all I wish I'd called
At least a thousand times or more
Just to hear what I've been missing

If a picture is all that I have
I can picture the times that we won't get back
If I picture it now it don't seem so bad
Either way, I still wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
Either way, I still wish you were here
[Verse 2: Fil Thorpe-Evans, 
Ben Barlow
]
Thinking back on the days
Where we all used to say
""I know anywhere's better than here""
In the back of the class
Where we grew up too fast
Living life like there's nothing to fear
But the ice on the road
Driving home all alone
Singing along to a song from three summers ago
The one that made you remember it
Now I'll always remember it (I'll always remember it)
As the song that your life ended with


If a picture is all that I have
I can picture the times that we won't get back
If I picture it now it don't seem so bad
Either way, I still wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me

And they say you're in a better place
(
They say you're in a better place
)
But a better place is right here with me
Yeah, they say you're in a better place
(
They say you're in a better place
)
Too bad it's not what I believe

'Cause a picture is all that I have
To remind me that you're never coming back
If I picture it now it just makes me sad
And right now I just wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be

Stumbled 'round the block a thousand times
You missed every call that I had tried
So now I'm giving up
A heartbreak in mid-December
You don't give a fuck
You'd never remember me
While you're pulling on his jeans
Getting lost in the big city
I was looking out our window
Watching all the cars go
Wondering if I'll see Chicago
Or a sunset on the West Coast
Or will I die in the cold?
Feeling blue and alone
I wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo

I hope you get your ballroom floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December


Cast me aside to show yourself in a better light
I came out grieving, barely breathing, and you came out alright
But I'm sure you'll take his hand
I hope he's better than I ever could've been
My mistakes were not intentions
This is a list of my confessions I couldn't say

Pain is never permanent, but tonight it's killing me

I hope you get your ballroom floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December

I miss your face, you're in my head
There's so many things that I should've said
A year of suffering, a lesson learned
I miss your face, you're in my head
There's so many things that I should've said
A year of suffering, a lesson learned


I hope you get your ballroom floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors

Almost forty-eight hours have passed since the fall of an atomic bomb and an attack upon the cities of man. And even now, we are only beginning to see the aftermath of a massive display of destruction and power that has uprooted our fresh outset of peace in civilized society. Despite the rubble, there is a predominant sense of wonder and marvel at the awesome nature of this technological terminus that has bewildered the very core of the human psyche

Sometimes, at night, I let it get to me
And sometimes, I'm sure it gets to all of us
And last night, it had me down, I'm feeling numb
I can try, but sometimes, that is not enough

No, sometimes, that is not enough
No, sometimes, that is not enough

And stop calling me out, we're never going to
Put the pieces back together
If you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna
See it all in bloom

And thinking back upon those days
Way, way back when I was young
I was such a little shit
'Cause I was always on the run
Well, you know just what they say
""Just like father, then like son""
Don't delude me with your sympathy
'Cause I can do this on my own


And this won't be the last time
That I break down and wanna crawl to bed
'Cause the truth is
You're the only voice I wanna hear in my head, so

Stop calling me out, we're never going to
Put the pieces back together
If you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna
See it all in bloom
(All in bloom)

And stop calling me out, we're never going to
Put the pieces back together
If you won't let me get better

And stop digging it up or we're never gonna
See it all in bloom

I'll paint you a picture with words

 we don’t talk in the same way that we used to
I’ll move on and forget you
We could never see eye to eye
But either way

headstrong, and independent

I’ll never forget her
And she’ll always have a part of me

I was falling for a girl who would ask me to come over
Just for a day, when her parents were away
Now all I can do is lay in my room
Fall asleep, dream of you
Then wake up and do nothing about it

I fell for a boy who could never ever let me walk home that way
‘Cause you gotta be safe
So hold back your views
We’re both leaving soon
I can’t fall back on you
‘Cause that’s not what I do and

I've been stuck in the middle pages
Hung up on a cross that I created
Built out of the bones that I've been breaking
The sign you said you needed
Is there but you can't see it
You might be down and out but you're still breathing

If you write the story
You'll find out we're all stuck on the same page

'Cause sometimes things will bend you
But trust me you'll be fine
'Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb
And life's not out to get you
Despite the things you've been through
'Cause what you give is what you get
And it doesn't make sense to make do
[Verse 2: Ben Barlow, 
Fil Thorpe-Evans

The walls are caving in again
Happens every now and then
Always got me feeling like I'm fucked (Fuck)
Falling in and out of bed
Sleep so hard feel like I'm dead
Trying to get a grip is kinda rough
Say life has lost its meaning
And that's true if you believe it
But someday you will stand above your demons
(You're not beneath this)

Sit still in the cold of February
Hold my hand in the cemetery and you'll be safe
And I know that this is only temporary
And I don't think that it's helping anything

And it's all fun and games until someone gets fucked up
This will end in tears, I could never be enough for you
Count my blessings on one hand and my curses on the other
I let you slip between my fingers
Hide away until the summer

Kali Ma lean over me
Rip your hand into my chest
Pull out my beating heart for the world to see
Then send me down to Hell
You ignore my pleas
Indiana couldn't save me
So I guess I'll save myself

We hopped from bench to bench in the middle of our town
Where the streetlights hit your eyes and then the tears came falling down
The love that you confessed, a product of your loneliness
I see right through you, but what do I do?


Of course I fall for it, just like I did when I was sixteen
Such a fool for you
Did you ever even miss me? Doubt it

Kali Ma lean over me
Rip your hand into my chest
Pull out my beating heart for the world to see
Then send me down to Hell
You ignore my pleas
Indiana couldn't save me
So I guess I'll save myself
Kali Ma lean over me
Rip your hand into my chest
Pull out my beating heart for the world to see
Oh, won't you go to Hell?

Pain, pain go away, come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me

I guess we'll never know
If when we're gone there's a place to go
Or if we don't see anything at all
Is that what we're supposed to call faith?
Well if that is that, and it all just fades to black
And we don't see anything at all
We don't see anything
What are you waiting for?

Pain, pain go away, come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me
I can't put my faith in a fallacy
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me

The world is a funny place
It kicks you when you're down
And knocks you out when you get up again
I don't think it's worth suffering through
But on the other hand
There's a world full of possibilities
And a million other people just like you
Who've all been through what you've been through
They were singing...


Pain, pain go away, come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me
I can't put my faith in a fallacy
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me

I saw it all flash and pass by with bright lights
And right before my eyes was the exit sign
I saw it all flash and pass by
And asked why I wasted precious time
It just passed me by
It just passed me by
We are just passing by (Just passing by)
Just passing by
Oh we are just passing by (Just passing by)
Just passing by

It's time to kick the habit, I'm coming clean
It's been a hell of a ride but it's all caught up with me
And now I'm off track
Feel like I'm right back where I started
Sat on the kitchen floor all alone talking to a ghost
About where we go when we go
He said, ""Life is the great unknown""
Better jump, better run and

Don't stop now
Though the motion sickness has you spinning out
'Cause you're on your way
Oh, my friend, just look how far you've come and
Think twice before you go and throw it all away

Between the peace and the panic
I can't break up the static
I need a cleaner frequency
I frequently burn out and vanish
I'm on another planet
There's just no getting through to me
But then I find myself in bed
Lost inside my head again
Running over everything
The voices, they are deafening
But out from the noise
I hear that familiar voice
He says ""Life is the great unknown""
Better jump, better run, better go
Better jump, run


Don't stop now
Though the

Let's start it here
Back in nineteen-seventy-sumthin'
I can't pin down the year
When the romance wasn't dead
And love still stood for something
There was a girl who'd lost her way
She blushed red when he came over
And they danced the night away
And he sung as he drove her home and
It was there that she would say
""If I could, then I would save you""
And he smiled and turned away
In six weeks they're saying ""I do""
Oh, love just don't go that way no more

And like the seed becomes the tree;
We take shape of a family
We grow and we change
And face the rain like you wouldn't believe
And through it all
We're standing tall
And I just don't say it enough
If not for you, no we wouldn't be standing at all


And now it's nineteen-ninety-sumthin'
How the hell did we end up here?
Four kids and a few jobs later
And the pictures fill the pages
It's been hard, oh it's been hard
But you'd be a fool to give it up
'Cause you know that what we've got is bigger than the two of us
It's been hard, oh it's been hard
But it's bigger than the two of us
And I will hold you in my arms
When you feel like giving up
Love just don't go that way no more

And like the seed becomes the tree;
We take shape of a family
We grow and we change
And face the rain like you wouldn't believe
And through it all
We're standing tall
And I just don't say it enough
If not for you, no we wouldn't be standing at all

And now its two-thousand-and-sumthin'
We made it here my dear
Grandkids and the mortgage paid off
Is this what dreams are made of?
'Cause baby we made it
Yeah baby, you saved me
But nothing could save him
From the ambulance that day
When he went away
The heart attack was sharp
He didn't feel no pain
If you saw him now then what
What would you say?
I love you and I miss you
I owe you everything
And I hope you know you saved me 
(Saved me!)


Oh mother
Mother please don't cry
'Cause you know I miss him too
I didn't even say goodbye
And though he's gone, I know he's gone
He lives on in all of us
And I will hold you when you cry

(Oh mother!)
Yeah, that's what he would've done

Oh what a time to be alive!
Wake up and smell the dynamite
And keep your eyes locked tight to that screen
And don't believe everything that you see

The golden groves are lined with affluence and roses
But the bagheads down by Central Station
Are closer to where home is
It can be grim and send you West from time to time
Yeah, this place is such a shipwreck
But this shipwreck, it is mine

Day by day, we grew to love this place
And where I make my grave, my anchor lays

I've been wasting away
But in a town with no way out
There's not much else to do anyway
If you're looking for a place to decay
Then there will always be a place in my town called revelry

I've seen a punch or two, narrowly escaped a few
And if you can get the day off, I could show you a view
I remember the football games
The first time that I got laid
And the time J broke his finger drinking by the lake


Day by day, we grew to love this place
And where I make my grave is where my anchor lays
The sound of my youth echoes out through these empty streets
I guess I can't kick up the roots
It's home, and that's the truth

I've been wasting away
But in a town with no way out
There's not much else to do anyway
If you're looking for a place to decay
Then there will always be a place in my town called revelry

We know what it's like to be put down
So fuck you to the world, and stand your ground
We know how to turn it inside out and get a little bit rowdy
We know what it's like to be put down
So fuck you to the world, and stand your ground
We know how to turn it inside out and get a little bit-

I've been wasting away
But in a town with no way out

It's home, and that's the truth
I've been wasting away
But in a town with no way out
There's not much else to do anyway
If you're looking for a place to decay
I've been wasting away
But in a town with no way out
There's not much else to do anyway
I'm not stuck, I'm staying (I'm not stuck, I'm staying)
And if you've got sorrows to drown
And the bottom's where you're bound","It is a positive… But the bagheads down by Central Station Are closer to where home is Yeah, this place is such a shipwreck But this shipwreck, it is mine I've been wasting away But in a town with no way out There's not much else to do anyway If you're looking for a place to decay I've seen a punch or two, narrowly escaped a few I remember the football games The first time that I got laid I guess I can't kick up the roots It's home, and that's the truth I've been wasting away But in a town with no way out There's not much else to do anyway If you're looking for a place to decay I've been wasting away But in a town with no way out There's not much else to do anyway I'm not stuck, I'm staying (I'm not stuck, I'm staying) And if you've got sorrows to drown And the bottom's where you're bound"

I thought I saw a girl brought to life
She was warm, she came around like she was dignified
She showed me what it was to cry
Well, you couldn't be that girl I adored
Don't seem to know, don't seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know her anymore

There's nothing where she used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's right, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins and now


I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can touch, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see

Bound and broken on the floor

Lime St. Lyrics
“Lime St.” is about a memory with a past girlfriend that the narrator can’t get out of his head, and all the things he wished he’d said at the time.

The title is most likely about the Liverpool Lime Street…

It's been a few days since I saw you last
And there's a few things that I have to ask
And so the first is, do I hold you back?
And did I fuck up too many times?
Found the bad I know you'd find

And just need some time and space
We've fallen out of place
But I pray to God we don't lose connection
Just need to see you smile or maybe stay awhile
Before we lose all sense of direction

Is it too late to say, too late to say
That I'm sorry for the things I do?
I'm missing you like shit today
And as the world spins on its axis
Seems like it's brought me back here
To say, ""Oh God, not this again""

And I haven't seen you smile this whole time
It bums me out and makes me wonder why I can't do right
And I'm trying my best, I promise (I promise)
And I want this as long as you want it


You asked me where we could meet
I found you there at Lime Street
One cig left in the packet
Stood shy in your dad's jacket
A moment I'll always keep
Oh, take me back to Lime Street
I swear to God you save me
Oh, I swear to God you save me

Is it too late to say, too late to say
That I'm sorry for the things I do?
I'm missing you like shit today
And as the world spins on its axis
Seems like it's brought me back here
To say, ""Oh God, not this again""

Disrupt and keep dividing, the government is lying
I'm not gonna be a fallacy of this society
Turn off your TV station, that's not real information
Trying to define the human mind, it's like puppetry
And they've got you by your strings, playing God for money
A sorry, sad charade, you can see right through it

Don't wait for anyone to say it for you
Say it for yourself
What if God was the beggar in disguise?
Would it make any difference? Would you open your eyes?

Suspend your disbelief, are you paying close attention?
If you blink, then you might miss their tricks and their deception
Distrust and disobey the lies they say 'cause all the world's a stage
And if you choose to read the news, then you must question everything
And they've got you on your knees, they've got your milk and honey
Then we put them on parade and celebrate what's coming

Don't wait for anyone to say it for you
Say it for yourself
What if God was the beggar in disguise?
Would it make any difference? Would you open your eyes?


No kings, no queens, 
no justice, no peace
Dig deep, believe, the truth will set you free
No kings, no queens, 
no justice, no peace
Dig deep and see the government is lying

Don't wait for anyone to say it for you
Say it for yourself
Yeah, what if God was the beggar in disguise?
Would it make any difference? Would you open your eyes?

It's another day
Wanna get away from here
There's a plane out on a runway
Gonna run away from here
'Cause the rain is so terribly dull
And it bores me
Yeah misery adores me

I wanna break out and get away
I wanna just try and live for me
'Cause if we don't try then we won't believe that we could've had it
I wanna let go, and fall for you
And when it gets rough, be your parachute
I wanna do the things that you only read about
Are you ready?

I'm done with small-town politics
I need to make my way to where the action is
I'm done with it, so the question is

Or we could turn the light off and go back to bed

Silhouettes on the ceiling
I’ve been much better, but at least I’m healing
You know I haven’t slept since you left
But, for me, that’s progress, for me that's progress

I’ve been fraying at the fabric
Strung out and biting on the back of my bottom lip
I’ll tell you everything is copacetic

I built my guard up to the clouds
Because of you, I’ve been reduced from high-rise windows to stepping stones

There’s gotta be something more for me
More than framework and furniture
Free fall into foreign waters
You tore me down, you tore me down

You tore me down

How many times must we walk this line?
 (You can look but you can’t touch)
How many times can I say I’m fine?

I’ll take it inward so no one sees
While you find slumber on tops of trees
And after all of this I still find it hard to breathe
I taught myself things you never did
You need a spine like I need new skin
But neither will ever happen

How dare you guilt me for not sticking around
As if you ever did for me?
I’ll leave you in the dark with a broken flashlight
You left me with a choice and a pretense
[Verse 2: Joe Taylor & 
Nick Casasanto
]
I will not follow in your footsteps
I’ll find a face to call my own
Because the mask you wear is all I’ve ever known
Consider this a repercussion of the actions which you were never properly punished for
Due to an overbearing demeanor brought on by your own self-awareness
Your credibility is a half-empty glass of salt water
That I watched you spill over and over and over again
Go ahead, make me the bad guy

How dare you guilt me for not sticking around
As if you ever did for me?
I’ll leave you in the dark with a broken flashlight
You left me with a choice and a pretense

[Bridge: Joe Taylor & 
Nick Casasanto

So I’ll take what strength I have left, if you could call it that 
(If you could call it that)
And I’ll give you time to reflect
Then you can call me back
(Then you can call me back)

How dare you guilt me for not sticking around

I've got a lot to talk about
My disdain for the Pacific threw my name into distant mouths
The heart is heavy when the words are weighing you down
I'm so fucking far down

Crosscheck
, 
let the turbines shake
 
the overheads
It took fifteen hours
 
and a missed connection
Overwhelmed and I'm overstepping bounds
[Verse: Joe Taylor, 
Nick Casasanto
]
I've had a lot to think about
The questions linger but I'm too scared to speak out
Like what could you possibly see in a failure like me?
Make no mistake, 
the winds have changed
And I'll be catching the resulting tidal waves
On an empty slate to the landlocked states

Crosscheck, let the turbines shake the overheads
It took fifteen hours and a missed connection
Overwhelmed and I'm overstepping bounds

And if you're picking up on the misdirection
Keep the status quo with an ear against the ground
And if you let me stay I'll keep out of the way
I'll be the empty canvas if you be the paint
And if you let me stay I'll keep out of your way
My space is yours to occupate",https://genius.com/Knuckle-puck-disdain-lyrics,"The…

Want Me Around Lyrics
“Want Me Around” is a song about a relationship that is likened to a postcard. It is clear that on the surface, they present a picture-perfect image of the relationship, but what lays underneath and goes…

Afraid to call and see what's good
Or is it simply understood
That there's a reason you don't want me around?
Want me around

When the lake is freezing cold and the city's underground
Will you feel me like the snow
Building up without a sound?
'Til I melt back into view
A bottle of red and a case of blues
Can I fall back into you?

You're unfazed by the time we wasted
Saving face
Through the postcard on the floor
'Cause I screwed up like before
They say that time heals everything
But what if time is everything?

Afraid to call and see what's good
Or is it simply understood
That there's a reason you don't want me around?
You play it chay and that's okay
But I don't buy the whole charade
Like it's a secret you don't want me around


When the air is filled with smoke
On the fourth day in July
Will you watch my heart explode?
Shed a brilliant disguise
In a disappearing bloom
I caught the darker shade of you
Then you dipped like you always do

You're unfazed by the time we wasted
Saving face
Left a postcard on the porch
'Cause I've grown up a little more
They say that time heals everything
But what if time is everything?

Afraid to call and see what's good
Or is it simply understood
That there's a reason you don't want me around?
You play it chay, and that's okay
But I don't buy the whole charade
Like it's a secret you don't want me around
(Want me around)


I've been awake since five AM
(Want me around)
Do you even wonder where I am?
(Want me around)
I've been awake and I'll stay awake
(Want me around)
Until you see me again

So will you call and see what's good
Or is it simply understood

No Good Lyrics

Where's your respect?
And didn't your father teach you anything before he left?
I'm not coming back
Oh no, I'm not coming back
Not coming back

My mind was a fortress you knew how to rupture
Flanking the trenches and storming my bunker
Day after day, I face the wrath of what I've made
But I never thought I could feel this way at 19

Every word she said
Like knives in the back of my head
Over and over she said:
""I'm just not cut for the weather
So take your wedding bands and your drunken friends
'Cause I just can't keep you together""
I'm no good, you're no better

It's people just like you
Who made me the pessimist I am
I'm lower than the dirt
With no roots left to find
It's nice to know I wasn't worth the seven digit letdown
I was left out in the cold


It's people just like you
Who made me the pessimist I am
It's people just like you
Who made me the pessimist I am

Every word she said
Like knives in the back of my head
Over and over she said:
""I'm just not cut for the weather
So take your wedding bands and your drunken friends
'Cause I just can't keep you together""
I'm no good, you're no better
Don't point your unloaded gun at my head ever again

I did what I do best
Forgot myself
Got overdressed like everybody else

A glance and a half smile
Black heels on the white tile
It took seven years for your path to realign
But I'll still think of you
On the fifth of June
'Cause when I saw you I lost you all over again

Doesn't it feel good to be invisible?
(Gone)
Just like the way I used to be

Yeah, I'm so gone
Gone

And I can feel your stare like dynamite
Breaking silence with Irish goodbyes
But I'm not who you remember
Just who do you remember?
Since you stole it all away
You stole it all away
You need a change of pace without my ghost

A painful anecdote sure to stunt your growth

Evergreen Lyrics

This is where it starts, right here, square one
Head for the door back to the west coast
Setting sail on concrete oceans
Feel the hills roll on engulfed in flames
Where red woods tower over me
Where there’s so much more than we think there is to see

I’ll lead a life of firsts on foreign soils
Somewhere that I can find the bones of a better man inside
(Somewhere that I can find)
Holding on tightly to the misery will never get me far
It will never get you far

As I exhale this breath of fresh air
I feel the distance tear the space between us
'Cause we’re always climbing toward the sun
But the cabin pressure gets to me
And there’s so much more than we think there is to see

On to barren land and wasted weeks but we won’t keep searching
We’re fucking helpless
And I feel the staleness in the autumn air, it’s not like usual
It’s fucking hopeless


I’ll lead a life of firsts on foreign soils
Somewhere that I can find the bones of a better man inside
(Somewhere that I can find)
Holding in tightly to the misery will never get me far
It will never get you far
[Outro: Joe Taylor, 
Nick Casasanto
, 
Dan Lambton

I’ll leave this all behind for you when I’m gone
You grew from a seed
Forever strong as a pine tree
Always an evergreen
I’ll leave this all behind for you when I’m gone
You grew from a seed

Always an evergreen
I’ll leave this all behind for you when I’m gone

If you bottle every first impression
And sent them out to sea
But forgot mine, it would still find a way to me
'Cause the viewpoint never changes

You learn a lot about honesty from the dried out leaves of the fallen trees in your life
Forgiving pathetic excuses for long term abuse is something I could never justify with God

You live in a lonely state of denial and self-decay

[Chorus: Joe Taylor, 
Nick Casasanto

Disguise your memory with pictures on the walls
(Am I good enough? Am I good enough?)
Replace my every flaw, the ones you never even saw
(As if you tried to, you never tried to)
We dream in color, but see in black and white
Between the covers, we sleep on beds of lies
Someday your true contrite will find you

Your world is what you've made it
Is this all you bartered for?

But Why Would You Care? Lyrics
[Verse 1: Joe Taylor & 
Nick Casasanto
]
These hands are broken and calloused
But nobody seems to notice
And you yelled it into permanence
Have you ever come to hate
The very thing that you helped to create?
Cause that's how I feel every day

I am expendable
But I guess that's just the way things go
I'm a ghost in foreign postal codes
Losing faith in what brings you hope

I am expendable
But I guess that's just the way things go
I'm a ghost in foreign postal codes
Losing faith in what brings you hope
[Verse 2: Joe Taylor & 
Nick Casasanto
]
On the outside looking in
Or on the inside sitting in the corner
It's all the same to me
It's all the same to me
I got my hopes up
I thought I was out of the shadows
But I'm buried
 six feet underneath
What I worked for years to achieve
While they were sleeping
While you were sleeping


I am expendable
But I guess that's just the way things go
I'm a ghost in foreign postal codes
Losing faith in what brings you hope
[Verse 3: Joe Taylor & 
Nick Casasanto
]
Home alone where all of my doubts are born (Home alone)
Home alone where all of my fears are formed (Home alone)
I'm sick and tired of hating who I've become (Home alone)
It's getting worse every day I spend home alone (Where all of my doubts are born)
Writing myself to death stands in place of sleep (Home alone)
I am an unlocked door and you're a fucking thief

These hands are broken and calloused
But nobody seems to notice

Wall to Wall (Depreciation) Lyrics

You’re displaced and overcompensated
You’re a waste, but I’m the one who’s wasted underneath
I'll seek my value underneath

Wall to fucking wall depreciation
You twist my tongue with costly dividends
Twice the effort, half the outcome
And how can I step forward when there’s not much to step for?
I’m sinking lower with every growth spurt
Decay, decay, decay

I guess you’re just not wired that way
It must be nice to be so figured out
You’ve got a fire in your eyes and I’ve got a burning in my throat
The difference always bothered me but I kept it to myself

You twist my tongue with costly dividends

Why won't I step forward when there’s so much to step for?

I had that dream again
Grinding teeth through an absent head
Losing control again
To forget is to be calm
By passing broken fingers through aching palms
You will awake again

If all you are is under the surface
Then why is it so hard to be a conduit?

""I went lucid,"" she said
Tried every minute of my waking unconsciousness
To start again
But the man in the doorway, he always had better plans
'Cause an idle mind is the fault of idle hands
And you can't break the boy to forge a better man

The cracks in the street outside this house
Are not the only thing that misery surrounds
I know you hate yourself
It’s the only common ground that we can depend on
(And it kills me to see your face because you never deserved this)
And while I’m dying at this desk, you’re dying in your head
The life you always dreamt; I’m living it instead

All the things I thought I earned were never mine all along
You emptied every pocket to bail me out of Bedford Falls
And I owe you everything
(My life included)
For sacrificing happiness
(While I stay secluded)

I sailed away from you
On a vessel that I made from all the things you gave to me
It’s keeping me afloat, but I still worry
Because I’m treading in this sea of doubt in my self consciousness
And all you want is for me to be happy

All the things I thought I earned were never mine all along
You emptied every pocket to bail me out of bedford falls
And I owe you everything. My life included
For sacrificing happiness while I stay secluded

Fucked and complacent
Condemned to my basement
Get lost in these tracks while you’re lost on that bridge where you stand
There’s nothing but guilt left inside
You go home and sit alone every night
It never seemed fair to me
I’d be nothing without you
I’d break through the ice and i’d drown in my self-centered abyss

Poison Pen Letter Lyrics
The third track on their debut LP Copacetic, “Poison Pen Letter” explores a failed relationship built on lies and how it all hurt Joe when finding out that everything the person he cared for was just a lie.

Once a young boy enamored by the things that you gave me
Now a young man you wouldn’t try
Cause all you turned out to be was a fallacy
That I outgrew quickly
With a busted hand and a bad knee, the patterns ossify
Your sorrow’s magnified
The culprit will be tried

I’ll gather fragments in the palm of my hand
To self-reflect on the coward
Who took the opportunity to turn their back on me
You left me standing there all alone praying to a Jesus
Something I don’t believe in

So now I’m self medicated to block out everything
Including walls you built around me
And I’ve been dodging demons as a pastime
At this point I’m not even sure if I’m alright
You couldn’t find time
You'll never find time

I’ll gather fragments in the palm of my hand
To self-reflect on the coward
Who took the opportunity to turn their back on me
You left me standing there all alone praying to a Jesus
Something I don’t believe in


I’m not sad, I’m through sulking
I’m not breaking, I’m not buckling
I’m not sad, I’m through sulking
I’m not breaking, I’m not buckling

I’ve Given Up On You Lyrics

You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down and down
You're the reason why I can't listen to those same songs I used to

I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind

I've given up on you
But it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry
I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night

It's 4 a.m. and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom?
Lately, my dog's the only one around that listens to my problems

It's been a lonely year
It's been a lonely year
It's been a lonely year
It's been a lonely year


I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind

I've given up on you
But it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry
I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night

Get By Lyrics

I've been dodging the question far too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls?
Leaving won't fix your problems

I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless

You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on 'cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)

You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
(What are you running away from?)


I hate to say I told you so

You're not the only one

You'll get by while I get better

Swallowing the feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor

I’ll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine

From the outside, I seem fine
On the inside, I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside, I seem fine

Redefine rock bottom
With these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralyzed before (never felt this paralyzed)

With the hangman’s broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor

I Don’t Love You Anymore Lyrics

I can't believe you've got the nerve to say you love me
Then you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me
And now you're just nothing but a memory

No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space

Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
I'm gone and I'm never coming back

No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you

Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about

Late Nights In My Car Lyrics

I've been up spending every late night in my car
Listening to all these sad songs
I know it sounds weird
But they're helping me move past all these things running through my head
I'll blame the mid-west and sleepy eyes

I'm not where I should be
I'm not what I could be
But I'm not who I was

Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up
And makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was 18
And my bony knees

Don't want it to be like my teenage years
I was naive and weak back then
Without much trouble on my shoulders
If I don't break
I won't know how to put myself back together


Nostalgia gets the best of me
When I wake up it's the same day
It fucks me up
And makes me miss who I used to be
All I have are thoughts of me from back when I was 18
And my bony knees

If you never break
You'll never know how to put yourself back together

Summer Lyrics

You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart
I never thought I'd live to see today
You're still in my mind
But not in my chest
I'm a little worn out since you fucking tore me down

You made me believe we had something
I guess that I was wrong
I thought I would be numb to this by now
I guess I was wrong

I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you

Stick with me or don't stick around at all
I was the boy who was too scared and ran away
I was the glue that never dried
You were the girl that made up her mind
And left me all alone to die


I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you

I'll sit on my basement floor
Turn off all the lights and try to not think about you
Just know that when I'm down there
I'll know that I won't be running through your mind
You were easy on my eyes
You were heavy on my heart

I miss you like the summer
Right now I think I need you here
But I don't really need you
I'll get through the winter without you
And I'll get through the winter without you

The patience I once had
Is running away with my youth
Away in it's hand
I've been neglecting who I am
That's just who I was back then
Don't need to be perfect
Just happy

I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy

Last year, I was a train wreck
Now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself

Every once in a while
I listen to Death Cab and think
About how it used to be
We thought that we knew the answers
But no one was asking
Asking the questions


I'm still a lost boy
I'm still a lost boy

Last year, I was a train wreck
Now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be

It feels like I've been taking the long way
For a while now
Haven't been at home in more years
Than I care to say
I keep letting my past carve out
What the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be

Sixteen Lyrics

Just when I think I need someone
They wrap their arms around my old bones
And I start breaking apart
I walk away from anyone that cares about me
But I swear my skin's not as rough as I make it out to be

The saddest part is I've been distant since I was sixteen
It keeps me up in bed
I'm stuck here with all the choices I've made
And the chances I was too afraid to change

I've called myself young and stupid
But lately I feel old and desperate
I find it kind of weird how you find yourself
When you have no one
I look for the right things in all the wrong places

Me First Lyrics

I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality

You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality

Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere

You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting

Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)

I'm feeling sorry for you

Unconditional Love Lyrics

Unconditional love and a lack of patience
Is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you dig up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know

You let me down but you never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast
As time moves slow
You let me down but you never let me go
Let me go

The hand that eats to feed
No mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls that keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know


You let me down but you never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast
As time moves slow
You let me down but you never let me go
Let me go

Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
'Cause I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety it's not fair
And let me go
Unconditional love
And a lack of patience is what you gave me

You let me down but you never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast

Loose Ends Lyrics

As the night goes on
I go from feeling out of place to feeling like a ghost
You miss me when I'm gone
But when I'm around it's like I'm hidden behind the paint on the walls
The loneliness will keep me warm tonight
It'll keep me warm seeing as you won't

I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this

If the open road is my home I'm never leaving
All of the small towns make me throw away my biggest fears
And the big cities make the fucked up stuff feel smaller

I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more than this

When I'm not here does anyone miss my secondhand smoke?
Do you wonder where I am or who I'm with?
Call me a mid-twenty sob story
I can't change the way I feel


I know I've got loose ends leaving me to spend
Too many nights driving down dead ends
I guess I'm looking for something more
Looking for something more",https://genius.com/Real-friends-loose-ends-lyrics,"As the night goes on

Composure Lyrics

Losing balance as I weigh out my options
It's an everyday morning routine
Through every hazy memory
At any second you could recap the climax
It’s not as vivid as it used to be
Through every hazy memory

The walls were built so high
But couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide
Only houses self-doubt

I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately, I’ll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
I’ve been avoiding conversation
But lately, I’ll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable

Life's unfolding like the plot of a movie
Not the version that everyone sees
My dreams laid out in front of me
(Like dreams laid out in front of me)
I never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me


The walls were built so high
But couldn't keep their words out
The shelter they provide
Only houses self-doubt

I'm reclaiming my composure
Lately, I’ll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable
I’ve been avoiding conversation
But lately, I’ll bend, smile, and pretend to be stable

The walls were built so high
But couldn't keep their words out

Not the version that everyone sees

I never told anyone, but the truth is I see
The shadow hanging over me

Only houses self-doubt
I'm reclaiming my composure
I’ve been avoiding conversation
The walls were built so high
But couldn't keep their words out

Empty Picture Frames Lyrics

I'm getting pretty good at leaving
My patience isn't wearing thin
Autumn never ends in my head
No matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch
And I'm the leaves falling from the top
Of every leafless tree

The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see

All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down
Save your time spent wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind

I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself


The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see

I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace

The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see",https://genius.com/Real-friends-empty-picture-frames-lyrics,"I'm getting pretty good at leaving

Looking Back Lyrics
I try to find a way out of this hole
But I'm dug in deep, and it's walls are steep
Been down so long it seems like all I've known
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
Woah Woah
It seems like it gets harder every year
I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me, or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
I gave my very best, with the purest intent
And I'll be proud when I look back",https://genius.com/Real-friends-looking-back-lyrics,"I try to find a way out of this hole

Hello Sunshine, or what's your name today?
Well you look so graceful but I’m not faithful
Do you really wanna be with me?
Hello Summer, or should I say goodbye?
Well it’s been so long but I’m still thinking if it’s worth another try

Well I've got a lot to talk about if you still wanna listen
Or if you even care

I'm just trying to find my place in this world
And I know it’s not so right to feel this way about a girl
But if you stay or if you go, I’m right there with you
But you know that I’m looking for more than a pretty smile
And if I'm lucky you can stay for a while
But if you stay or if you go
I'm just hanging on again

Hello Stranger, we haven’t had a past
But now I’ve learned so much, so much, yeah, time's gone by so fast

But you know that I’m looking for more than a pretty smile
And if I'm lucky you can stay for a while
But if you stay or if you go
I'm just hanging on again
I'd love to say
I'd love to say

You caught me in the right place
At the right time, so I'll just dive right in
Say you've got a blank space in your right mind
Well, here's my second wind
Oh, your idea of me blown away, away
Something in the past tense
Didn't make sense for this to follow through
What did you expect to happen?
Were you mad then with nothing left to do?

Oh, you're making me sick, what is this?
Had we been drawn too close before?
Because I dropped my forgiveness
It's lying face-down on the floor

I've got more secrets than you'll ever know
Another year and you won't let it go
Too many times I told myself to hold on
But it's too late for me, now I'm as good as gone

Funny how we go way back and we said that
We wouldn't let this come between
Everything, and is it true that I could look past
Memories and stay obscene?
Oh, your idea of me blown away, away

Something's telling me I never
Could have ruined everything you want in life
Because you never put in the effort, and the truth is
You were never doing it right

Oh, you're making me sick, what is this?
Am I the one you can't ignore?
Because I dropped my forgiveness
It's lying face-down on the floor

I've got more secrets than you'll ever know
Another year and you won't let it go
Too many times I told myself to hold on
But it's too late for me
Now I'm as good as gone

It turns out I don't go down that easily
You'll never really know what this means to me
And no, it wasn't ever too much to hold
But you stole your own self-control
It turns out I don't go down that easily
You'll never really know what this means to me
And no, it wasn't ever too much to hold so just know


I've got more secrets than you'll ever know
Another year and you won't let it go
Too many times I told myself to hold on
But it's too late for me, now I'm as good as gone

Not everybody wants an enemy

Pulled aside as if I was the wrong one
You said it all and you made me the lost one
Elevated by your greatest mistake
Now I'm all alone
I bet you couldn't tell that I felt the same way
Struggling just to get to the next day
I'm not force-fed lies
While I'm by your side

Shaking your head doesn't change this
I'm preparing myself for a trainwreck
I can't be saved

So tell me, why can't you see
This is where you need to be?
You know, it's taken its toll on me
But I don't feel invisible
Tell me, why can't you see
This is where you need to be?
You know, its taken it's toll on me
So I'll hope for a miracle
Yeah, I'll hope for a miracle


Holidays tend to make me feel whole again
Rainy days make me feel like the dream is dead
I can show you what it's like to be down
When you're all alone
I'm quite aligned to your design
What's mine is yours, and that's just fine
I'm finally acquiring the state of mind
That everything is gonna be alright

Shaking your head doesn't change this
I'm preparing myself for a trainwreck

You know, its taken its toll on me
So I'll hope for a miracle
Yeah, I'll hope for a miracle


And if you want to be free
I can't be the one to make you believe
You've still got this promise to keep
Step back and wash away the reckless intentions
They're leaving me breathless
Find a way to stay in your skin

So why can't you see
This is where you need to be?
You know, its taken it's toll on me
But I don't feel invisible

Been around the world and back this year
Told myself I wanna face this fear
But I don't think I can stand on my own
She's got eyes like spring, legs like the summer
Everybody says she looks just like her mother
But I think she wants that left alone

There's too many ways to say goodbye
But it's quite the opposite this time

Sometimes I can't help but say
I'm falling in love and it's scaring me

But this is just the life I ordered
One step back and two steps forward
Sometimes I can't help but say

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
(When you're dead and gone)
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
(When you're dead and gone)

One year ago with a flower in hand
One year ago we wrote our names in the sand
The wind would blow your summer hair
(One year ago)
Once easy love, now you're making it rough
You know I try and say it's never enough
You left with ease and didn't care
(One year ago)

What used to seem like heaven
Feels like hell

I wanna breathe with ease again
I wanna get some fucking sleep again
You only ask forgiveness after it's gone wrong
I need to get upstate again
I need to get my head on straight again
You only get redemption when you're dead and gone
When you're dead and gone


Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
(When you're dead and gone)
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Ten years from now we'll be tired and old
Ten years from now we won't ever leave home
Singing ""I'll be there for you""
(Ten years from now)
Give me the one and only reason that could make me believe
You were everything I want, but not the thing that I need
It's hard to say, it's sad but true

What used to seem like heaven
Feels like hell

I wanna breathe with ease again
I wanna get some fucking sleep again
You only ask forgiveness after it's gone wrong
I need to get upstate again
I need to get my head on straight again
You only get redemption when you're dead and gone
When you're dead and gone


Nothing left here to say
Nothing to celebrate
Nothing left here to say
Nothing here to celebrate

I wanna breathe with ease again
I wanna get some fucking sleep again
You only ask forgiveness after it’s gone wrong
I need to get upstate again
I need to get my head on straight again
You only get redemption when you’re dead and gone

Losing Myself Lyrics

I said I'll always remember the wood grain beneath my feet in a busy street
I never said I was angry, but I think I'm still in misery
But it's what I needed and you took me by surprise

Sometimes I think I'm bound for losing it all
And I thinking I'm weighing
I think I'm weighing us down
But no, I won't fall, and I wouldn't trade it
I wouldn't trade it
I'm down for life

Another day I was selfish
It reminds me of my wasted youth and all the one's and two's
I try to live in the moment
It reminds me of the time we spent trapped in your apartment
We attract what we're ready for
It's something I can't ignore

Sometimes I think I'm bound for losing it all
And I thinking I'm weighing
I think I'm weighing us down
But no, I won't fall, and I wouldn't trade it
I wouldn't trade it now


Maybe some promises were broken; wasn't holding tight
But now I wanna know what it feels like
Sometimes I think I'm bound for losing it all
But I wouldn't trade it
I wouldn't trade it
I'm down for life
Call it off, I've made my move
I'm defenseless and I could use some time on my own and a place to say
I'm losing myself in the best way
Done with anything basic
I've had enough of the same shit

Tell me why
We attract what we're ready for
It's something I can't ignore

Sometimes I think I'm bound for losing it all
And I thinking I'm weighing
I think I'm weighing us down
But no, I won't fall, and I wouldn't trade it
I wouldn't trade it now


Maybe some promises we're broken; wasn't holding tight
But now I wanna know what it feels like
Sometimes I think I'm bound for losing it all

All You Are Is History Lyrics

I'm a realist and an optimist
But I swear to you, I'm not getting over this

Walking tall in a small town
Full of yourself when you're feeling down
And that's all that matters to you
Can't pretend anymore
Talk is cheap, I said that before
But you can still taste it
And that's one more reason why you're never gonna make it

I've had enough of all the talk on how you're saving me
Talk like you're self assured but all you are is history
Speak slow, I want you to know that
I'm a realist and an optimist
But I swear to you, I'm not getting over this
No, no, I'm not getting over this

You've got the right be all that you wanna be
And that's extra ordinary
Is it worth the risk?
(Can you handle it?)
I can't pretend anymore
You don't wanna leave, you said that before
Oh, but you can still taste it
And that's one more reason why you're never gonna make it


I've had enough of all the talk on how you're saving me
Talk like you're self assured but all you are is history
Speak slow, I want you to know that
I'm a realist and an optimist
But I swear to you, I'm not getting over this

Fall back in line, it's too much to expose
It's your design and that's the way it goes
I think I know my limits, and how to make good decisions
It hits home, so just go

I've had enough of all the talk on how you're saving me
Talk like you're self assured but all you are is history
Speak slow, I want you to know that
I'm a realist and an optimist
And that's one more reason why you're not getting over this

I forgot how you tasted
Just another night wasted
Spilling yourself all over me like you don't care, don't care
Anyway
If I wrote it right off the page
Guess I'm safe for another day
Telling myself I can block out the distance like I don't care, don't care
Cue reality

I hope it all comes back again
I want to get stuck in your head like 'Everlong' playing on the late night radio (radio)
Because you lit a match with your nails on my back
And something tells me I'll never learn
Just another slow burn

Now you got my attention
Did I forget to mention I'll be gone by tomorrow, on a plane to Chicago
I say it's not fair, not fair anyway
(But you don't care either way)

I hope it all comes back again
I want to get stuck in your head like 'Everlong' playing on the late night radio (radio)
Because you lit a match with your nails on my back
And something tells me I'll never learn
Just another slow burn


We set a fire at both ends with our best lines
And best intentions
Let go of what we know and make tonight our reinvention
We set a fire at both ends with our best lines
And best intentions
Let go of what we know and make tonight our reinvention

I hope it all comes back again
I want to get stuck in your head like 'Everlong' playing on the late night radio (radio)

And something tells me I'll never learn
Because you lit a match with your nails on my back
And something tells me I'll never learn

Criminal Lyrics

So what's it mean
When every dream I have's about you now?
I can't believe
You get to me the way you do somehow
It's criminal

Believe me
It's easy to let this go deeper
The taste could be sweeter, come on
You're too strong
And far gone
I'll keep my composure, just tell me

What this is really all about
I feel you tearing down
Castles in my head
When we're in different beds

So what's it mean
When every dream I have's about you now?
I can't believe
You get to me the way you do somehow
It's criminal
It's criminal
It's criminal


I'm sideways
Can I say you pull me to pieces?
Just tell me your secrets, come on
For what it's worth
I'm most concerned with how you got me here in the first place

What's it really all about?
I feel you tearing down
Castles in my head
When we're in different beds

You're too strong (You're too strong)
And far gone
I'll keep my composure, just tell me


What's it really all about?
Feels like you're tearing down
Castles in my head
While we're in different beds
And I'm a world away
Somehow you'll come find me
Too close to stay on track
Tossing and turning back
It's criminal

I can't believe
You get to me the way you do somehow

I'm looking in the rearview mirror
Everything looks the same
There's nothing but broken streetlights
And I'm just trying to escape
I'm waiting on a distant feeling
I'm waiting for things to change
It's getting hard to ride on empty
But maybe I'm not so far away
'Cause it feels like home

I found a reason
And suddenly I'm not so alone
I'm finally breathing
Like I never could on my own
Start the countdown, let's get it on
Scream our lungs out to our favorite song
'Cause this is where I belong
(This is where I belong)

I can tell you just don't get it
And that you'll never understand
I'm sorry that I can't be perfect
But I'm not changing who I am
Maybe there's no destination
Maybe I'm gonna make mistakes
Let you in on one of my secrets
I'm still just as lost as yesterday
But it feels like home

Like I never could on my own

Scream our lungs out to our favorite song
'Cause this is where I belong

Look past the warning signs
The same ones that told me
I should just turn back and run
""Play it safe before you come undone""
If you saw through my eyes
This view is worth the time
Believe me when I say
There's no place in this world I'd rather be

It’s all the same

Crystal Ball Lyrics

When it all began, was it time that we asked for?
Or was it anything to feel complete forevermore?
Wanna see myself like I used to back then
But every time I turn around I’m in LA again
Don’t take this for granted, that’s not how we planned it
I know, we’re tearing these pages
Before we get to watch it unfold

Yeah, it’s a long road
You think your time is running out
Gotta be looking up when it goes down

Know that I’ve seen better days
Turned and looked the other way
But with you I can’t see past the crystal ball
(To all we ever wanted)
I can’t fight this disconnection
You can see my imperfection
Still, at least I’ll never be ungrateful

Opposite of here there’s a bold faced enemy
But sure enough, when I look up
It’s myself staring back at me
I’m not saying there’s a reason
Close it up and leave it, even though
We’d still be tearing the pages
Before the rest of it changes
So let’s go


‘Cause it’s a long road
You think your time is wearing thin
Remember to breathe out when you dive in
(Oh, when you dive in)

Know that I’ve seen better days
Turned and looked the other way
But with you I can’t see past the crystal ball
(To all we ever wanted)
I can’t fight this disconnection
You can see my imperfection
Still, at least I’ll never be ungrateful

I think my nights are my days
I can feel you slipping away
So savor every moment
Don’t you stay in disarray
I think my nights are my days
I can feel you slipping away
Can we savor every moment
Find ourselves along the way
I confess


That it’s a long road
You think your time is running out
Gotta be looking up when it goes down

Know that I’ve seen better days

Never thought we'd end up here
Now our future seems so clear
I can see the top of the world down here
Drawing on the window pane
Wanna hear them say my name
All I have are whispers and dreams down here

Nothing hurts more than saying I'm fine

Not a second to waste
Life won't wait for you now
This is our time to go
Feel the crash of the waves
Wash away all the thoughts
That come at you like monsters at night
I don't wanna live this way
Strong enough to break these chains
Broken pieces can mend
Not a second to waste
Life won't wait for you now
This is our time, our time to go

When I've got it figured out
All alone I get knocked down
Looking at the stars from the floor, down here
Can't be held down in this place
You can see it in my face
Wishing I could open the door, down here


Nothing hurts more than saying I'm fine

Not a second to waste
Life won't wait for you now
This is our time to go
Feel the crash of the waves
Wash away all the thoughts
That come at you like monsters at night
I don't wanna live this way
Strong enough to break these chains
Broken pieces can mend
Not a second to waste
Life won't wait for you now
This is our time, our time to go

I'm walking down this road
Nobody's hand to hold
Way past the point of no return
You strike a match, get burned

Not a second to waste
Life won't wait for you now
This is our time to go
Feel the crash of the waves
Wash away all the thoughts
That come at you like monsters at night
I don't wanna live this way

Wait just a little bit longer
Before you stab me in the back and walk away
‘Cause I’ve grown a little bit stronger
And now you’re choking on those deadly words you ate
I can’t wait to watch you fall
Like the castle you built on sand

I won’t let you live my life from inside my head now
Let you out, it’s hard to pretend how
On, and on, and on it goes
Your heart is black and mine is gold
Make my way to places I’m bound for
Don’t you say that you wanted this more
On, and on, and on it goes
Your heart is black and mine is gold

Take all the time that you asked for
‘Cause I can see the lack of energy in your eyes
I’m walking out through the back door
‘Cause there’s no point to waste away these days inside
I’m learning how you’re burning down
All the bridges you built by hand


I won’t let you live my life from inside my head now
Let you out, it’s hard to pretend how
On, and on, and on it goes

Frozen Lyrics

Thought I wouldn't last a minute
Now you wanna make the minutes last
If that's not a miss what do we call that?
Maybe I messed up a little
Or maybe I'm a little messed up
We've been walking on ice but is it strong enough?

With everything that's burning up inside of me
Here's something for your diary
You had the opportunity
To find out just what we could be but all was frozen after all

You say that I was way too different
Now you know me in a different way
So let me cross it off
I haven't lost enough
I think it's safe to say
I tripped up now but I'm still standing
And I won't be standing still
We're not thawing out, don't think we ever will


With everything that's burning up inside of me
Here's something for your diary
You had the opportunity
To find out just what we could be but all was frozen after all

You know I tried my best
I asked for your heart but you asked for a breather
Now I feel it in my chest
I wasn't ready for this but you weren't either

I had a dream last night
We drove out to see Las Vegas
We lost ourselves in the bright lights
I wish you could have seen us
Begging for change to get home
Or at least San Francisco
Let's put a ten on the high card
And spend a summer on the West Coast

Down and to the left
Here's a map and a pen, the place you pointed at
Be California's best
All I ask, all I ask

Hey, please don't tell me that I'm dreaming
When all I ever wanted was to
Dream another sunset with you
If I roll over when it's over
I'll take this Cali sunrise with me
And wake up with the fondest memories

We made love by the ocean
As the waves crashed around you
Sunsets never were so bright
And the skies, never so blue
You opened up into my arms
And we laughed as I held you
I'll never go back to Georgia
Not at least 'til I have to

Miserable at Best Lyrics
[Verse 1: 
Jake Bundrick
]
Katy, don't cry, I know
You're trying your hardest, and the hardest part is letting
Go of the nights we shared
Ocala is calling,
 and you know it's haunting
But compared to your eyes
Nothing shines quite as bright
And when we look to the sky
It's not mine, but I want it so
[Chorus: Derek Sanders and 
Jake Bundrick
]
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there and
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
She'll say yes
Because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess, but I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you, I'll be miserable at best

You're all that I hoped I'd find in every single way
And everything I would give is everything you couldn't take
'Cause nothing feels like home, you're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living is just taking breaths to stay
'Cause I know I'm good for something, I just haven't found it yet
But I need it, so

[Chorus: Derek Sanders and 
Jake Bundrick
]
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight

Because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess, but I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you, I'll be miserable at best

And this will be the first time in a week
That I'll talk to you and I can't speak
It's been three whole days since I've had sleep
'Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek
And I got the point that I should leave you alone
But we both know that I'm not that strong and
I miss the lips that made me fly, so
[Chorus: Derek Sanders and 
Jake Bundrick

oh, without you I'll be miserable at best","[Verse 1: Jake Bundrick ] Katy, don't cry, I know Ocala is calling, and you know it's haunting But compared to your eyes Nothing shines quite as bright And when we look to the sky It's not mine, but I want it so [Chorus: Derek Sanders and Jake Bundrick ] Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight I know he's there and You're probably hanging out and making eyes While across the room he stares I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor And ask my girl to dance She'll say yes Because these words were never easier That I can live without you but Without you, I'll be miserable at best You're all that I hoped I'd find in every single way 'Cause nothing feels like home, you're a thousand miles away 'Cause I know I'm good for something, I just haven't found it yet But I need it, so [Chorus: Derek Sanders and Jake Bundrick ] Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight I know he's there and You're probably hanging out and making eyes While across the room he stares I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor Because these words were never easier That I can live without you but Without you, I'll be miserable at best It's been three whole days since I've had sleep 'Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek I miss the lips that made me fly, so [Chorus: Derek Sanders and Jake Bundrick ] Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight I know he's there and You're probably hanging out and making eyes While across the room he stares I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor And ask my girl to dance She'll say yes Because these words were never easier That I can live without you, but without you I'll be miserable And I can live without you, but without you I'll be miserable And I can live without you, but, oh, without you I'll be miserable at best"

Terrible Things Lyrics
In this song, a father tells his son about the love story between himself and his wife, the boy’s mother, and why she isn’t here with them, anymore, to prepare his son for what love gives and takes away.

By the time I was your age, I'd give anything
To fall in love truly, was all I could think
That's when I met your mother, the girl of my dreams
The most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen
She said, 
""Boy can I tell you a wonderful thing?
I can't help but notice, you're staring at me
I know I shouldn't say this, but I really believe
I can tell by your eyes that you're in love with me.""

Now, son, I'm only telling you this
Because life can do terrible things

Now, most of the time we'd have too much to drink
And we'd laugh at the stars and we'd share everything
Too young to notice and too dumb to care
Love was a story that couldn't compare
I said, ""Girl, can I tell you a wonderful thing?
I made you a present with paper and string
Open with care now, I'm asking you, please
You know that I love you, will you marry me?""

Now, son, I'm only telling you this
Because life can do terrible things
You'll learn, one day, I'll hope and I'll pray
That God shows you differently


She said, ""Boy can I tell you a terrible thing?
It seems that I'm sick and I've only got weeks
Please, don't be sad now, I really believe
You were the greatest thing that ever happened to me.""


Slow, so slow I fell to the ground on my knees
So don't fall in love, there's just too much to lose
If you're given the choice, then I beg you to choose
To walk away, walk away, don't let her get you
I can't bear to see the same happen to you

Now, son, I'm only telling you this
Because life can do terrible things",https://genius.com/Mayday-parade-terrible-things-lyrics,"The most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen

You Be The Anchor That Keeps My Feet On The Ground, I’ll Be The Wings That Keep Your Heart In The Clouds Lyrics

And honestly I have been begging for answers
That you and only you can give to me
My voice crying loud
I've been crying for days now
And as I start to run, I stop to breathe

(And I was nearly scared to death)
And I was nearly scared to death
(Of why you left in paragraphs)
Of why you left in paragraphs
(The words were nearly over us)
The words were nearly over us
You stop and turn and grab your bags

And I'll be here by the ocean
Just waiting for proof that there's sunsets and silhouette dreams
All my sandcastles fall like the ashes of cigarettes
And every wave drags me to sea
I could stand here for hours
Just to ask God the question, ""Is everyone here make-believe?""
With a tear in His voice, He says, ""Son, that's the question.""
Does this deafening silence mean nothing to no one but me?


As hours move to minutes
And minutes take longer to break
I will be desperately awaiting
When my tongue won't fall apart
And we've been sitting here for hours
All alone and in the dark

So let me think of how to word it
Is it too soon to say 'perfect'
?
If I could find another thirty minutes somewhere
I'm sure everything would find me
All that's left is just to sing

And I'll be here by the ocean
Just waiting for proof that there's sunsets and silhouette dreams
All my sandcastles fall like the ashes of cigarettes
And every wave drags me to sea
I could stand here for hours
Just to ask God the question, ""Is everyone here make-believe?""
With a tear in His voice, He says, ""Son, that's the question.""
Does this deafening silence mean nothing to no one but me?

And if you sing to me sweet until then
I may never sail Virginia again
And as this current moves slow for me
This much you must know: we'll meet again
And El, I'll have you know I'm scared to death
Tell me once again
That you'll love me to the death
And should I die, you swear that you will come for me
As I fade away, you reach out your hand


(And please don't let me go)
And please don't let me go
(And please don't let me go)
And please don't let me go

And I'll be here by the ocean
Just waiting for proof that there's sunsets and silhouette dreams
All my sandcastles fall like the ashes of cigarettes
And every wave drags me to sea
I could stand here for hours
Just to ask God the question, ""Is everyone here make-believe?""

Piece of Your Heart Lyrics

Give me your misery, all of it give it to me
I can hold onto it for you, it’s not a problem
I just want your energy, a piece of that fractured mountain
I’ll take whatever comes with it as long as it’s yours

And all I know is that I want it more than yesterday
If I was waiting, I was waiting for just one little spark
You are the brightest I’ve seen, you are the best side of me
And just for when we’re apart I’ve got a piece of your heart

But I want the whole damn thing

I feel it inside of me, I feel it inside of you too
Seeing forever this downcast bleed from the sky
Could never sever through, not what we have me and you
Burning together and burning forever

And I don’t know, I just can feel it in the atmosphere
If I’m wandering, I’ve wandered into just the right spot
You are the fire in my sleep, you are the reason I dream
And just for when we’re apart I’ve got a piece of your heart


I’ve got a piece of your heart, but I want the whole damn thing

Say hello to all my problems for me
Tell them sorry, I can’t be around anymore
The years will go on, we’ll get older and then we’ll die
But we’ll get by

And it goes on forever just like this
If I could go back, I would do it all over with you again
I’ve got a piece of your heart, but I want the whole damn thing

Say hello to all my problems for me
Tell them sorry, I can’t be around anymore
The years will go on, we’ll get older and then we’ll die

I swear that you don't have to go
I thought we could wait for the fireworks
I thought we could wait for the snow
To wash over Georgia and kill the hurt
I thought I could live in your arms
And spend every moment I had with you
Stay up all night with the stars
Confess all the faith that I had in you (I had in you)

Too late, I'm sure and lonely
Another night, another dream wasted on you
Just be here now against me
You know the words, so sing along for me, baby

For heaven's sake I know you're sorry
But you won't stop crying
This anniversary may never be the same
Inside I hope you know I'm dying
With my heart beside me
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
And if I died right now you'd never be the same

I thought with a month of apart
Together would find us an opening
And moonlight would provide the spark
And that I would stumble across the key
Or break down the door to your heart
Forever could see us - not you and me
And you'd help me out of the dark
And I'd give my heart as an offering (an offering)


Too late, I'm sure and lonely
Another night, another dream wasted on you
Just be here now against me
You know the words, so sing along for me, baby

For heaven's sake I know you're sorry
But you won't stop crying
This anniversary may never be the same
Inside I hope you know I'm dying
With my heart beside me
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
And if I died right now you'd never be the same
And I will always remember you as you are right now to me
And I will always remember you now, remember you now
So sleep alone tonight, with no one here just by your side
Sleep alone tonight
How does he feel, how does he kiss?
(Let's sleep alone tonight)
How does he taste while he's on your lips?
(With no one here just by your side)
How does he feel, how does he kiss?
(Sleep alone tonight)

How does he feel, how does he kiss?
(Let's sleep alone tonight)
How does he taste while he's on your lips?
(With no one here just by your side)
How does he feel, how does he kiss?

I can't forget you
(Let's sleep alone tonight)
I know you want me to want you, I want to
(With no one here just by your side)
But I can't forget you
(Sleep alone tonight)
So when this is over don't blow your composure, baby
I can't forget you

I know you want me to want you, I want to

When you're alone, do you think of me?
And my diamond ring's thrown out to sea
And when you love, do you love for me?
Like harmony, a never ending dream

Oh well, oh well
I still hope for the best
Say goodbye send me off with a kiss farewell
And I promise I'll be just as strong as I can be
Maybe you could get some sleep tonight

So here's your song
It's twisting me
I'd give anything to make you scream
And I'll just smile, and make believe I don't feel a thing
That doesn't work for me

Oh well, oh well
Guess I'll see you in hell
There's a pretty little picture that's in my head
And I'm starting to dream, changing colors while I sleep
Maybe I'm just wasting time


Sit still and listen to the soundtrack
I'll tell you how I took one straight through the heart
And it's not easy to talk about
So we all scream loud

And that was it
I had made it clean just across the street with my new wings
So I'll just fly and hope that I remember the good times when it's done

Oh well, oh well
I can't live with myself
As I'm climbing in your window to get to your bed
And I'll be what you need
You can call me anything
Just as long as we're still friends

Sit still and listen to the soundtrack
I'll tell you how I took one straight through the heart, and it's not easy to talk about
So we all sing

When she smiles well it's got nothing to do with me
I'm not the one who sings her to sleep
And I've been talking to God asking for just a little help with you but it's hopeless
It's not the first time but this one really carved it in
And tell your new friends that they don't know you like I do
It's over
I wanna see you again
I wanna feel it again
Oh, Oh it's not the first time, but this one really carved it in
Tell your new friends that no one knows you like I do
It's over
I wanna see you again
I wanna feel it again

When I Get Home You’re So Dead Lyrics

The words are coming, I feel terrible
Is it typical for us to end like this?
Am I just another scene from a movie that you've seen
One hundred times?
'Cause baby you weren't the first or the last or the worst
And I've got to fill the blanks in the past with a verse
And we could sit around and cry but frankly
You're not worth it anymore

So say hello to all the boys at the top
Of this table that you're under
Lipstick lullabies
This is sorry for the last time
And baby I understand that you're making new friends
This is how you get by
The moral this time is:
Girls make boys cry, and I...

On any other day I'd shoot the boy
But your simple toy had caused a scene like this
Leave him hanging on the walls, just a picture in the hall
Like a hundred more (Like a hundred more)
Consider this as a gift as you taste him on your lips
And he's making you scream with his hands on your hips
I hope he's leaving you empty baby this is just a fix
Such a simple little whore


So say hello to all the boys at the top
Of this table that you're under
Lipstick lullabies
This is sorry for the last time
And baby I understand that you're making new friends
This is how you get by
The moral this time is:
Girls make boys cry, and I

And your name remains the same
All that has changed is this pretty face
So pull the trigger, it never gets closer (And your name remains the same)
You want to start over, never start over
Pull the trigger, it never gets closer (All that has changed is this pretty face)
You want to start over, but never start over

So say hello to all the boys at the top
Of this table that you're under
Lipstick lullabies
This is sorry for the last time
And baby I understand that you're making new friends
This is how you get by

If You Wanted A Song Written About You, All You Had To Do Was Ask Lyrics

I'm throwing away pictures
That I never should have taken in the first place
And it's cold in my apartment
As I'm changing all the colors
From the brightest reds to grays

Well it's 3 o'clock on Monday morning
I'm just hoping you're not seeing his face
I've been getting calls in these hotel rooms
Long enough to know that it was him
That took my place

And I hope this makes you happy now
That the flame we had is burning out
And I hope you like your pictures facing down
As even broken hearts may have their doubts

And I'm burning all the letters
Hoping that I might forget her and the bad taste
That she left when she was leaving me
A life of barely breathing as she walked
Out of this place
And you dropped the note and we changed key
You changed yourself and I changed me
I really didn't see us singing through this
Then you screamed the bridge
And I cried the verse
And our chorus came out unrehearsed
And you smiled the whole way through it
I guess maybe that's what's worse


And I hope this makes you happy now
That the flame we had is burning out
And I hope you like your pictures facing down
As even broken hearts may have their doubts

And I'm taking all your memories off the shelf
And I don't need you or anybody else
So take a look at me
See what you want to see
When you get home

Take me home
I'd rather die than be with you
Take me home
You have a problem with the truth
Take me home
Because this happens every time
I knew it would...
I knew it would...
Take me home
I'd rather die than be with you
Take me home
You have a problem with the truth

And I knew it would...

Stay Lyrics

I need some time, just deliver the things that I need for now
Everything that I feel's like a warm deep calm casting over me
And it's taking me to somewhere new
If you believe that everything's alright
You won't be all alone tonight
And I'd be blessed by the light of your company
Slowly lifting me to somewhere new

Oh, can you tell I haven't slept very well since the last time that we spoke?
You said, ""Please understand, if I see you again, don't even say hello.""
Please

What a night it is, when you live like this
And you're coming up beneath the clouds
Don't let me down
All the love's still there, I just don't know what to do with it now
You know, I still can't believe we both did some things
I don't even wanna think about
Just say you love me and I'll say, ""I'm sorry
I don't want anybody else to feel this way""
No, no, no

Can you tell I haven't slept very well since the last time that we spoke?
I said, ""Please understand I've been drinking again, and all I do is hope""
Please... stay
Please stay


I'll admit I was wrong about everything
'Cause I'm high and I don't wanna come down
All the fun that we had on your mothers couch
I don't even wanna think about
I'm not strong enough for the both of us
What was I supposed to do?
You know I love you
Whoa-oh

Please stay (stay)

I’d Hate to Be You When People Find Out What This Song Is About Lyrics

And we both go down together
We'd stay there forever
Just try to get up
And I'm sorry this wasn't easy
When I asked you believe me
And never let go

Well, I'm thinking of the worst things
That I could say to you
But a promise doesn't mean a thing anymore

And this never will be right with me
And now you're trying desperately
But I'm tongue tied and terrified of what I'll say

And then we both go down together
We may stay there forever
I'll just try to get up
And I'm sorry that this wasn't easy
When I asked you believe me
You never let go
But I let go


I could only sing you sad songs
And you could sing along
And you could see the melody
Has been calling out your wrongs

And this never will be right with me
And now you're trying to desperately
But I'm tongue tied and terrified of what I'll say

But I never told you everything
I'm losing hope and fading dreams
And every single memory along the way

And then we both go down together
We may stay there forever
I'll just try to get up
And I'm sorry that this wasn't easy
When I asked you believe me
You never let go
But I let go
And we both go down together
And stay there forever
Just try to get up

This is the longest day I've ever had
I'm far away but I am right there
If distance only makes you stronger
Don't make it last any longer
My mind is racing and it won't stop
And every thought is something negative
I hope this doesn't last forever
We're always meant to be together
I won't lie, this hurts more than you'll ever know

That's when something told me that

If I pinch myself so that I wake
That means it never really happened
'Cause I can feel my tears finding their way
I fear it's worse than I imagined

I'm sick of writing every thought out
Reliving every single moment
Say what you mean, it's now or never
Because nothing is forever
I won't lie, this hurts more than you'll ever know
(The thought of you all alone)
Your eyes rolled back as you fade to black
(It's not worth living without you)


That's when something told me that

If I pinch myself so that I wake
That means it never really happened
'Cause I can feel my tears finding their way
I fear it's worse than I imagined

But I'll hold this memory
And I swear I won't forget your face
'Cause pictures always seem to fade away
Now my blood turns red to blue
And I can't breathe without you
Now my blood turns red to blue
And I can't breathe without you
No, I can't breathe
No, I can't breathe

If I pinch myself so that I wake
That means it never really happened
'Cause I can feel my tears finding their way
I fear it's worse than I imagined


But I'll hold this memory
And I swear I won't forget your face

Why do they always fade away?

Never Sure Lyrics

To be alone together just once again
Is something that is sure to happen sometime
If my hands can't stay on the table
And if I find myself unable
To look away from staring in your eyes
And the color of the sunrise inside
I promise that I'll hold myself together
And act like this isn't killing me

I saw you once today
I painfully watched as you looked the other way
Afraid just to notice me standing there
You would make it obvious, you don't care

I won't lie, I only love you for the heartbreak
I only love you for the give and the take
No, you know I want it

I'm in love with the thought of everything
I am lifted to a holy ground
And from up here can see a little of everything
And I can see you don't want me around
And I know how much that it makes you cringe
To think about you and I as friends
Together, forever, until the end
After that, you won't have to see me again


I won't lie, I only love you for the heartbreak
I only love you for the give and the take
No, you know I want it
And when I die, just rip my heart out from my chest
And put it in a mason jar left to rest on your bedside table

And if there's any hope alive after all
I would hold it like a newborn baby
And care for it like it was my own
Hey, you know, it looks kinda like me
And we'd still get chills every time we kiss
And I will always promise this, that to you I will never tell a lie
No, not to you
No, not to you

I won't lie, I only love you for the heartbreak
I only love you for the give and the take
No, you know I want it

You're asking the questions but not listening to the answers you get
That must be hard to do
It must be about as hard as forgetting your best friends
You said we'd leave no one behind
To prove what you had wasn't dead inside
But we know, yeah, everyone knows what a selfish prick you've become

And I remember when one single moment was enough
To convince yourself to jump in because you wanted to
It's not that far
At least it didn't seem so from down there
But from up here
It seems that everything I love is so far away
There used to be many things that I could hold and touch
And grab onto in stormy weather
These days we have each other

I Swear This Time I Mean It Lyrics
Oh Florida please be still tonight
Don't disturb this love of mine
Look how she's so serene
You've gotta help me out
And count the stars to form the lines
And find the words we'll sing in time
I want to keep her dreaming
It's my one wish, I won't forget this
I'm outdated, overrated
Morning seems so far away
So I'll sing a melody
And hope to God she's listening
Sleeping softly while I sing
And I'll be your memories
Your lullaby for all the times
Hoping that my voice could get it right
If luck is on my side tonight
My clumsy tongue will make it right
And wrists that touch
It isn't much, but it's enough
To form imaginary lines
Forget your scars, we'll forget mine
The hours change so fast
Oh God, please make this last

I'm outdated, overrated
Morning seems so far away
So I'll sing a melody
And hope to God she's listening
Sleeping softly while I sing
And I'll be your memories
Your lullaby for all the times
Hoping that my voice could get it right
Could get it right
You could crush me
Please don't crush me
'Cause baby I'm a dreamer for sure
And I won't let you down

Your lullaby for all the times
Hoping that my voice could get it right","Oh Florida please be still tonight Don't disturb this love of mine Look how she's so serene You've gotta help me out And count the stars to form the lines And find the words we'll sing in time I want to keep her dreaming It's my one wish, I won't forget this I'm outdated, overrated Morning seems so far away So I'll sing a melody And hope to God she's listening Sleeping softly while I sing And I'll be your memories Your lullaby for all the times Hoping that my voice could get it right If luck is on my side tonight My clumsy tongue will make it right And wrists that touch It isn't much, but it's enough To form imaginary lines Forget your scars, we'll forget mine The hours change so fast Oh God, please make this last I'm outdated, overrated Morning seems so far away So I'll sing a melody And hope to God she's listening Sleeping softly while I sing And I'll be your memories Your lullaby for all the times Hoping that my voice could get it right Could get it right You could crush me Please don't crush me 'Cause baby I'm a dreamer for sure And I won't let you down I swear this time I mean it And I'll sing a melody And hope to God she's listening Sleeping softly while I sing And I'll be your memories Your lullaby for all the times Hoping that my voice could get it right"

MakeDamnSure Lyrics
The first single from the band’s third album, Louder Now, and also their most successful commercially to date. The song describes the ugly side of a relationship.

You've got this new head filled up with smoke
And I've got my veins all tangled close
To those jukebox bars you frequent
The safest place to hide
A long night spent with your most obvious weakness, you start shaking at the thought
You are everything I want
'Cause you are everything I'm not

And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close
(How close is close enough?)
And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close

I just wanna break you down so badly
Well I trip over everything you say
I just wanna break you down so badly
In the worst way

My inarticulate store-bought hangover hobby kit it talks
And it says ""You, oh, you are so cool""
Scissor-shaped across the bed
You are red, violent red
You hollow out my hungry eyes
You hollow out my hungry eyes


And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close
(How close is close enough?)
And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close

I just wanna break you down so badly
Well I trip over everything you say
I just wanna break you down so badly
In the worst way
I just wanna break you down so badly
Well I trip over everything you say
I just wanna break you down so badly
In the worst way
Worst way

I'm gonna make damn sure
That you can't ever leave
No, you won't ever get too far from me
You won't ever get too far from me
I'll make damn sure
That you can't ever leave
No, you won't ever get too far from me
You won't ever get too far from me
You won't ever get too far from me (Ever get too far)
You won't ever get too far


I just wanna break you down so badly
Well I trip over everything you say
Well I just wanna break you down so badly
In the worst way
Worst way

I'm gonna make damn sure
I just wanna break you down so badly
I just wanna break you down so badly (Down so)

Boys like you are a dime a dozen
Boys like you are a dime a dozen""

You're a lush and I hate it

I'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt

[Verse 1: Adam Lazzara, 
John Nolan

Well, I can't regret, 
can't you just forget it?
I started something I couldn't finish
And if we go down, we go down together
Best friends means, 
well, best friends means
And 
I've got a twenty-dollar bill
That says
 you're up late night starting
Fist fights vs. the fences
In your backyard,
 
wearing your black
Eye like a badge of honor
Soaking in sympathy
From friends who never loved you
Nearly half as much as me
[Chorus: 
John Nolan
, 
with Adam Lazzara

Broken down in bars and bathrooms
All I did was what I had to
Don't believe me when I tell you
""It's just what anyone would do""
Take the time to talk about it
Think a lot and live without it
Don't believe me when I tell you
""It's something unforgivable""

I started something I couldn't finish Best friends means, well, best friends means And I've got a twenty-dollar bill That says you're up late night starting Fist fights vs. the fences In your backyard, wearing your black Eye like a badge of honor Soaking in sympathy From friends who never loved you Nearly half as much as me [Chorus: John Nolan , with Adam Lazzara ] Broken down in bars and bathrooms All I did was what I had to Don't believe me when I tell you ""It's just what anyone would do"" Take the time to talk about it Think a lot and live without it Don't believe me when I tell you ""It's something unforgivable"" [Verse 2: Adam Lazzara, John Nolan ] Well, I can't regret, can't you just forget it?

Getting what you deserve (I hope there's ice on all the roads) (That's right, he said it...) The jealousy that became me thinking (And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt) (That's right, he said...) That you always had it way too easy (And again when your head goes through the windshield) [Chorus: John Nolan , with Adam Lazzara ] B roken down in bars and bathrooms All I did was what I had to Don't believe me when I tell you ""It's just what anyone would do"" Take the time to talk about it Think a lot and live without it Don't believe me when I tell you ""It's something unforgivable"" [Outro: Adam Lazzara, John Nolan , Both ] Best friends means I pulled the trigger Best friends means you get what you deserve Best friends means I pulled the trigger Best friends means you get what you deserve Best friends means I pulled the trigger Best friends means you get what you deserve Best friends means I pulled the trigger Best friends means you get what you deserve Best friends means I pulled the trigger Best friends means you get what you deserve Best friends means I pulled the trigger Best friends means you get what you deserve"

Adam Lazzara explained this song is about him and his ex-girlfriend buying a ticket to see Coldplay and then breaking up before the show (Adam’s fault, it seems), but since they already had the tickets, they…

Timberwolves at New Jersey Lyrics

Get up, get up
Come on, come on, let's go
There’s just a few things I think that you should know
Those words at best were worse than teenage poetry
Fragment ideas and too many pronouns
Stop it, come on, you’re not making sense now
You can't make them want you
They're all just laughing

Literate and stylish (Literate and stylish)
Kissable and quiet (Kissable and quiet)
Well that's what girls' dreams are made of
And that's all you need to know (And that’s all you need to know)
You have it or you don't (You have it or you)
You have it or you (Don't)

You have it in you
You're sick of my time you're wastin'
Girl, we're just separatin'
Stop it, come on, you know I can’t help it
I got the mic and you got the mosh pit
What will it take to make you admit that you were wrong?
Was his demise so carefully constructed?
Well let's just say I got what I wanted
'Cause in the end it’s always the same (It's justified)
Let's go


Literate and stylish (Literate and stylish)
Kissable and quiet (Kissable and quiet)
Well that's what girls' dreams are made of
And that's all you need to know (And that’s all you need to know)
You have it or you don't (You have it or you)
You have it or you (Don't), you don't

This is me with the words on the tip of my tongue
And my eye through the scope down the barrel of a gun (gun,gun)
Remind me not to ever act this way again
This is you trying hard to make sure that you're seen
With a girl on your arm and your heart on your sleeve
Remind me not to ever think of you again
This is me with the words on the tip of my tongue
And my eye through the scope down the barrel of a gun
Remind me not to ever act this way again (Again)
Again (Again)
This is me with the words on the tip of my tongue
And my eye on the scope down the barrel of a gun
I'll never act this way again
Rest the weight
(
I know something that you don't know
)
You've had your chance and folded
Don't hold your breath because you'll only make things worse
Rest the weight
(
I know something that you don't know
)
You've had your chance and folded
Don't hold your breath because you'll only make things worse


(
I know something that you don't know
)

I know something that you don't know

Liar (It Takes One to Know One) Lyrics

All our secrets they are tailored trouble
Draped loose now around your hips
Your spotless instincts are valid
We coexist
Got 26 days to work with (Got 26 days)
We've got 26 days to work with
(
It moves, it moves, it moves
)
We'll see what all gets done

I'm an addict for dramatics
I confuse the two for love
You can't tell me that you don't beg

Liar (Liar)
If we're keeping score
Then we're all choir boys at best
(Intrusive and arrogant)
Liar (Liar)
If we're keeping score
Then we're all choir boys at best
(Intrusive and arrogant)

Got 26 days to work with (Got 26 days)
Then back on that island that you swear by
Still barely can afford
It's still a question of ""How long will this hold?""
""Well is it any different now that we are"" (I said we are patient)
""Oh, don't you go there, not here, not now""
(
It moves, it moves, it moves
)
""Not here, not now""

You Know How I Do Lyrics
“You Know How I Do” is the opening track from Taking Back Sunday’s debut album, Tell All Your Friends.

It’s possible that the song is about a struggle with drugs and refusing to accept any help.
[Verse 1: Adam Lazzara, 
with John Nolan
]
So sick, so sick of being tired
And oh so tired of being sick
We're both such magnificent liars
So ""crush me baby, I'm 
all ears
""
So obviously desperate, so desperately obvious
I'll give in one more time and feed you
Stupid lines all about ""It's basic""
[Chorus: Adam Lazzara, 
John Nolan
]
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
Yeah, and uh, we won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore

So sick, so sick of being tired
And oh so tired of being sick
Willing and ready to prove the worst of everything you said about
So obviously desperate, so desperately obvious
So good at setting bad examples
Listen, trick, I've had all I can handle

John Nolan

We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore

We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore

We won't stand for
From a waste of time
Think of all the days you spent
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
Alone with just your TV set and I...
We won't stand for

Great Romances of the 20th Century Lyrics
“Great Romances of the 20th Century” is the fifth track on Taking Back Sunday’s debut Tell All Your Friends.

The song deals with the emotional toll that comes with ending a relationship.

September never stays this cold
Where I come from
And you know
I’m not one  (I'm not one) for complaining (for complaining)
But I love the way you’d roll
Excuses off the tip of your tongue
As I slowly fall apart (slowly, quietly, slowly)
Fall apart
Is falling apart
Is falling apart
Is falling apart

As of this won’t mean a thing come tomorrow
And that’s exactly how I’ll make it seem
Cause I'm still not sleeping
Thinking I’ve crawled home from worse than this

So please, please (please)
I’m running out of sympathy (I'm running out of sympathy!)
And I never said I’d take this
I never said I'd take this lying down

She says
""Come on, come on, let’s just get this over with""
She says
""Come on, come on, let’s just get this over with""
I never said I’d take this lying down
 (Let's just get this over with)
And I've crawled home from worse than this
She says
""Come on, come on, let’s just get this over with""
She says
""Come on, come on..""


You always come close but this never comes easy
I still know everything
You always come close but you never come easy
I still know everything
This always comes close but you never come easy
I still know everything
You always come so close...
I still know everything, I still know everything, I still know...

You always come close but this never comes easy
You always come close but you never come easy
You're coming in... you're coming close

I never said I'd take this lying down
I never said I'd take this lying down
I never said I'd take this lying down
But I've crawled home from worse than this

If it's not keeping you up nights
Then what’s the point
Then what’s the point
Then what’s the point
Then what’s the point


I'm in your room
Is this turning you on
Am I turning you on?
I'm in your room
Are you turned on?
I'm on the corner of your bed
I'm thinking maybe
Are you turned on?

Homicide Love Lyrics

One beat, one life
One me, let the other side go
Oh-oh-oh
I live and die by your knife
This is homicide love
Tell me, could you make me, oh
All that you want?
Would you fly home?
Or could it ever be just us?

Tell me what you're waiting for
Hold me like you did before
Or just run away, run away, run away
'Cause I don't think I could take much more
Why you always waging war?
Tell me why I'm keeping score
Oh, would you give me one, give me one, give me one more
Lie if this was truly love?
Truly love

You need your space
I can't breathe when we go your pace
Oh-oh-oh
You make me sick, but all I wanna do is kiss your lips
I'm such a sucker for sweet-talking, yeah
So do you tell all your friends
You've got your gun to my head?
I know it's never gonna be just us


Tell me what you're waiting for
Hold me like you did before
Or just run away, run away, run away
'Cause I don't think I can take much more
Why you always waging war?
Tell me why I'm keeping score
Oh, would you give me one, give me one, give me one more
Life if this was truly love?

Love, love
Love
Or is it nothing?
Or is it nothing?
Is it love? Love

Oh, you tear me down
You build me up
Kill me slow with your love
And I will try to be your love
Enough

Ghost Man on Third Lyrics
This is a song about mental health, or rather, mental unwellness.
Adam Lazzara was only 19 years old when he came to New York City from North Carolina to play with Taking Back Sunday, but he had already been…

John Nolan

Jynx me something crazy
Thinkin' if it's three then
I'm as smooth as the skin rolls across the small of your back
It's too bad it's not my style if you need me
I'm out and on the parkway patient and waiting for headlights
Dressed in a fashion that's fitting to the inconsistencies of my moods
It's times like these where silence means everything 
and no one is to know about this
It's times like these where silence means everything (
So no one is to know about this
)

[Verse 2: Adam Lazzara, 
John Nolan

But whatever I have been gettin' myself into lately
Has been slicing inches from my waist
It's my face vs. the bottle (
and thank god you weren't there
)
And that's how bad could this hurt
Against I won't feel a thing
(
And thank god you weren't there...
)
I tell you all about  it's just not working out

My Blue Heaven Lyrics
[Verse 1: Adam Lazzara & 
Fred Mascherino
]
Two sides twist and then collide
You're calling off the guards (
Am I coming?
)
I'm coming through (
Am I coming?
)
Adulteress conditioned to a spin cycled submission
You know, sometimes it just feels better to give in
Sometimes, it just feels better to give in

And it's all too familiar
And it happens all the time
All the cards begin to stack up
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime
But it's you I can't deny
You I can't deny
[Verse 2: Adam Lazzara & 
Fred Mascherino
]
Dull heat rises from the sheets
I'm both a patient boy
Well, and a jealous man (Am I coming?)
My double standardized suspicion
Is remedied, oh, my blue heaven
Sometimes, it just feels better to give in
(Sometimes, it just feels better to give in)


And it's all too familiar
And it happens all the time
All the cards begin to stack up
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime
But it's you I can't deny
(You I can't deny)

We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in my head starts to sing
""You're safe, child, you are safe
(You're safe, child, you are safe)
You're safe, child, you are safe""
We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in my head starts to sing
""You're safe, child, you are safe
You're safe, child, you are
Safe (Safe), safe (Safe)
You are safe""
We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in my head starts to sing
""You're safe, child, you are safe"" (Am I coming?)
""You're safe, child, you are safe"" (Am I-)
Coming through?


Is this all too familiar?
Does it happen all the time?
I'm just asking you to hear me
Could you please, just once, just hear me?

This Photograph Is Proof (I Know You Know) Lyrics
This song was featured on the Spiderman 2 soundtrack. The lyrics seem to paint the picture of a relationship where the girl has cheated and the guy knows of it.
[Verse 1: Adam Lazzara, 
Fred Mascherino
, 
Both
]
Well, I’ll wait ‘til you listen
I won’t say a word
To ‘follow your instincts’
Well, just never worked for me
But oh, I’m silent but strong
Yeah, I’m playing that card 
and you’re
Noticing nothing again
[Pre-Chorus 1: Adam Lazzara, 
Fred Mascherino
, 
Both
]
So, I’m lying on the table with everything you said
Keeping in mind the way that it felt
When the most I could do was to just blame myself
Feel it out for once and feel nothing like everyone else
(Most I could do was to just blame myself)
[Chorus: Adam Lazzara, 
Fred Mascherino
]
Well, I know you know everything
I know you didn’t mean it
I know you didn’t mean it
I know you know everything
 (
Drop everything
)
I know you didn’t mean it
 (
Start it all over
)
I know you didn’t mean it
(
And remember more than you’d like to forget
)

So, we’re talking forever, and you
Almost feel better, but
That is not excuse for tonight
You see, it’s never bad enough to just
Leave or give up but it’s
Never good enough to feel right

Fred Mascherino
,

Loved You a Little Lyrics

If I was just a lie to you
Well, you were less than that to me
Never loved you a little

Bit by bit, you built this all in your head
And you knew goddamn well
Lays like these, they lean miss more than swing
And what made you think that what we had was love not meaningless?
And if I'm the fool, what's that make you?

Don't tell me why (Don't tell me)
You can't sleep at night (You can't sleep)
I know now I won't ever do this again (I know now I)
(Won't ever do this again)

If I was just a lie to you
Well, you were less than that to me
Never loved you a little
Loved you a little
Tell me who you were falling for
When we were lying on the floor
Never loved you a little


Try not to think of me at all
When you're lonely and exposed
All I really know is
Tales like these tragically end badly
Blame me, either way
I was too far gone to say
I'm tired, it's a little too late

If I'm the fool, then what are you?
Don't tell me why (Don't tell me)
You can't sleep at night (You can't sleep)
I know now I won't ever do this again (I know now I)
(I won't ever do this again)

If I was just a lie to you
Well, you were less than that to me
Never loved you a little
Loved you a little
Tell me who you were falling for
When we were lying on the floor
Never loved you a little
Loved you a little
Never loved you a little
Loved you a little
I never loved you at all
At all (Loved you a little)


And what made you think that what we had was love?
And if I was the fool, then what does that make you?
What made you think that what we had was love?
And if I was the fool, then what does that make you?
And what made you think that what we had was love?
And if I was the fool, then what does that make you?
What made you think that what we had was love? (If I was just a lie to you)
And if I was the fool (Well, you were less than that to me)
Then what does that make you? (Never loved you a little)
Loved you a little (Yeah)

Tell me who you were falling for
When we were lying on the floor
Never loved you a little
Loved you a little
If I was just a lie to you
Well, you were less than that to me
Never loved you a little
Loved you a little

Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face
The kind you'd find on someone I could save
If they don't put me away
Well, it’ll be a miracle
Do you believe you're missing out?
That everything good is happening somewhere else
But with nobody in your bed
The night's hard to get through

And I will die all alone
And when I arrive I won’t know anyone

Well, Jesus Christ, I’m alone again
So what did you do those three days you were dead?
'Cause this problem's gonna last
More than the weekend
Well, Jesus Christ, I’m not scared to die
But I’m a little bit scared of what comes after
Do I get the gold chariot?
Do I float through the ceiling?

Do I divide and fall apart?
'Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark
And the ship went down in sight of land
And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands?


I know you'll come in the night like a thief
But I’ve had some time alone, to hone my lying technique
I know you think that I’m someone you can trust
But I’m scared I’ll get scared and I swear I’ll try to nail you back up
So do you think that we could work out a sign?
So I’ll know it's you, and that it's over so I won't even try
I know you'll come for the people like me
But we all got wood and nails
We turn, turn out hate in factories
Yeah, we all got wood and nails
We turn, turn out hate in factories
We all got wood and nails
And we sleep inside of this machine

If it makes you less sad, I will die by your hand
I hope you find out what you want, I already know what I am
And if it makes you less sad, we'll start talking again
You can tell me how vile I already know that I am

I'll grow old, start acting my age
It’ll be a brand new day in a life that you hate
A crown of gold, a heart that's harder than stone
And it hurts a whole lot but it's missed when it's gone

Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not
I'm glad that you can forgive
Only hoping as time goes, you can forget

And if it makes you less sad, I'll move out of the state
You can keep to yourself, I'll keep out of your way
And if it makes you less sad, I'll take your pictures all down
Every picture you paint, I will paint myself out

It's cold as a tomb and it's dark in your room
When I sneak to your bed to pour salt in your wounds
So call it quits or get a grip
You say you wanted a solution, you just wanted to be missed


Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not
I'm glad that you can forgive
Only hoping as time goes, you can forget

So you can forget, you can forget
You are calm and reposed, let your beauty unfold
Pale white, like the skin stretched over your bones
Spring keeps you ever close, you are second-hand smoke
You are so fragile and thin, standing trial for your sins
Holding onto yourself the best you can
You are the smell before rain, you are the blood in my veins

Kate, it's your ride
Get your petals out and lay them in the aisle
Pretend you're God and grow, and it’s your day to wed
We found your man, he's drinking up, he's All-American
And he'll drive
He's volunteered with grace to end your life
He'll tidy up
It's sad to hold, but leave your shell to us
You explode
You firefly,
 
you tiny boat with oars
Feather oars
The world tilts back and pours and pours
And so, you satellite
You tidal wave, you're a big surprise
And I've one more night to be your mother

The signal interrupted
My baby's frequency not strong enough
Remain in my hands and smile
We will miss you but in time you'll get settled
And we will write

A beauty supreme, yeah you were right about me
But can I get myself out from underneath?
This guilt that will crush me
And in the choir I saw a sad messiah
He was bored and tired of my laments
Said, ""I died for you one time but never again""

Kate, it's your ride
And he'll drive
He's volunteered with grace to end your life
He'll tidy up
It's sad to hold, but leave your shell to us
You explode
You firefly,
you tiny boat with oars
Feather oars
The world tilts back and pours and pours
And so, you satellite
You tidal wave, you're a big surprise
The signal interrupted
My baby's frequency not strong enough
Remain in my hands and smile
And we will write
A beauty supreme, yeah you were right about me
But can I get myself out from underneath?
This guilt that will crush me
He was bored and tired of my laments
Said, ""I died for you one time but never again""

The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows Lyrics
“The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows” is a song about being in a relationship and ending it prematurely because you know it’s going to end.

Thie song is the second single off Deja Entendu.

We saw the western coast
I saw the hospital
And nursed the shoreline like a wound
Reports of lover's trysts
Were neither clear nor descript
We kept it safe and slow
The quiet things that no one ever knows
[Chorus: Jesse Lacey & 
Vincent Accardi
]
So keep the blood in your head
And keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day we get tired
Today's the day we dro
pped out
Gave up my body and bed
All for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals
So keep the blood in your head
And keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day we get tired
Today's the day we dropped out
Gave up my body and bed
All for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals

I contemplate the day we wed
Your friends are boring me to death
Your veil is ruined in the rain
By then, it's you I can do without
There's nothing new to talk about
And though our kids are blessed
Their parents let them shoulder all the blame

[Chorus: Jesse Lacey & 
Vincent Accardi
]
So keep the blood in your head
And keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day we get tired
Today's the day we dropped out
Gave up my body and bed
All for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals
So keep the blood in your head
And keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day we get tired
Today's the day we dropped out
Gave up my body and bed
All for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals

I lie for only you
And I lie well
Halleluh
I lie for only you
And I lie well
Halleluh
[Chorus: Jesse Lacey & 
Vincent Accardi

So keep the blood in your head
And keep your feet on the ground

As we glide over whatever
We know to be over forever
I really hope the shame is less
For what we feel in times of stress

But I guess that's just depression
No sense in fighting it now
You had me caught in your headlights
You were running me down

We speak in tongues and start to teethe
Lift your voice and scrape your knees
Kids in love will plant a seed
Resurrect and start to breathe

I thought I was a creator
I'm here just hanging around
Got my messiah impression
Yeah, I think I got him nailed down

I want to tell you we're alright
Want to erase all your doubt
I've got this thorn dug in deeply
Sometimes I can't get it out
Sometimes I can't get it out
Sometimes I can't get it out
Sometimes I can't get it out


I'm strumming with a heavy wrist
Were you one of the cured kids?
My shins burn for the replica youth
I hope that we can eject soon

'Cause I don't want to surrender
Or lose your face in the crowd
I finally found all my courage
It was buried under the house

Not just a manic depressive
Toting around my own cloud
I've got a positive message

Part 1

This tape recounts a dream which occurred close to the termination of approximately 400 hours of intensive, individual therapy.
 
Now, the patient recounts her dream:

I had this dream earlier this morning and I wrote it down. 
The dream is that I'm in some sort of a... and I'm in a hotel I'm at... I'm like at a convention or something.
 And I feel sort of almost like there's too much going on. There are all different kinds of 
meetings
 going on. 
Stuff on experimental 
psych and therapy
, chemical aspects
. All of it
But, I'm... while 
I don't mind having all this going on inside of me.
 
It's sort of... I think I'm going to be relieved when it's over. When I can sort of settle back down
Part 2

It's where you live, but you don't know how it's built
If we're just dust, then it doesn't matter who you kill
Don't cut me up, then tell me that it's ok
Just turn it off 'cause I don't care anyway

It lit me up
It lit me up
It lit me up
It lit me up

Something stirrin' in a deep Atlantic trench
Doesn't forget the thousand years before it slept
It's the beast, it's my heart, it's old bread
I dive down into its unit in its head


It lit me up
It lit me up
It lit me up
It lit me up

It lit me up like a torch on a pitch black night
Like an ember in the needles of a dried out pine
It lit me up, and I burn from the inside out
Yeah, I burn like a witch in a Puritan town
It lit me
It lit me

When I grow up, I wanna be a heretic
I wanna climb over the wall 'cause I'm not on the list
I wanna put my hands to work 'til the work's done
I wanna open up my heart like the ocean

It lit me up
It lit me up
It lit me up
It lit me up


It lit me up like a rag soaked in gasoline
In the neck of the bottle breaking right at my feet
It lit me up, and I burned from the inside out
Yeah, I burned like a witch in a Puritan town
It lit me
It was a good dream

Goodbye to sleep
I think that staying up is exactly what I need
Well, take apart your head
Take apart the counting and the flock it has bred

Goodbye to love
It’s a ride that will push you up, right against the wall
Take apart your head
, right against the wall
Does everybody really need to know everyone?
Do you really think you’re really a part of it?
Chew it up and swallow it
And is your army really one of some thousands?
And will you declare war on the loony bin?

You burn bright but you run out
I fell asleep in the incline
I can't shake this little feeling
I'll never get anything right

Goodbye, you liar, well, you sipped from her cup
But you don't own up to anything
, then you think you will inspire
Take apart your head,
 I wish I could inspire
When I arrive will God be waiting and pacing around his throne?
Will he feel a little Old Testament?
Take apart the demon, in the attic, to the left
And will he celebrate with fire and brimstone
Yeah, I admit, I am afraid of the reckoning


Goodbye my love
You burnt bright but you run out
You wait right here, and they will come and pick you up
Let's sleep on the incline
I’ve been on pause but I’m shaking off the rust
I can't shake this tiny feeling
I’ve lost my charge, I’ve been degaussed
I never say anything right

(I'm on my own) 
I’ve been degaussed
I never say anything right (I'm on my own) 
I’ve been degaussed
I never say anything right (I'm on my own) 
I’ve been degaussed
I never say anything right, right, right (I'm on my own)

Take me, take me, back to your bed
I love you so much that it hurts my head
Say ""I don't mind you under my skin,""
I'll let the bad parts in, the bad parts in
When we were made, we were set apart
Life is a test and I get bad marks
Now some Saint got the job of writing down my sins
The storm is coming, the storm is coming, yeah


You burnt bright but you run out
I fell asleep at the incline
I can't shake this little feeling
I never did anything right

(I'm on my own)
I never did anything right (I'm on my own)

Take me, take me back to your bed
I love you so much, that it hurts my head
Say, I don't mind you under my skin
I'll let the bad parts in, the bad parts in
You're my favorite bird, and when you sing
I really do wish you would wear my ring

Seventy Times 7 Lyrics
The song title “Seventy Times 7” comes from a verse in the Holy Bible – Matthew 18:22 – where Jesus tells Peter he must forgive his brother “seventy times seven times”.

Then Peter came and said to him, “Lord…

Back in school they never taught us what we needed to know
Like how to deal with despair, or someone breaking your heart
For twelve years I've held it all together
But a night like this is begging to pull me apart
I played it quiet, left you deep in conversation
I felt uncool and hung out around the kitchen
I remember I kept thinking that I know you never would
And now I know I want to kill you like only a best friend could

Everyone's caught on to
Everything you do
Everyone's caught on to

As if this happening wasn't enough
I got to go and write a song just to
Remind myself how bad it sucked
Ignore the sun, the cover's over my head
I wrote a message on my pillow that says
""Jesse, stay asleep in bed""
So don't apologize (I hope you choke and die!)
Search your cell for something with which to hang yourself
They say you need to pray if you want to go to heaven
But they don't tell you what to say
When your whole life has gone to hell


Everyone's caught on to
Everything you do
Everyone's caught on to

And everyone's caught on to
Everything you do
Everyone's caught on to
And I can't let you
Let me down again
And I can't let you
Let me down again

So, is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with
'Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish
I've seen more guts in 11-year-old kids
Have another drink and drive yourself home
I hope there's ice on all the roads
And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt
And again when your head goes through the windshield
Is that what you call tact?
You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back
So let's end this call, and end this conversation
And is that what you call a getaway?
Well tell me what you got away with
Cause you left the frays from the ties you severed
When you say best friends means friends forever


Is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with?
'Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish!
I've seen more guts in 11-year-old kids!
Have another drink and drive yourself home!
I hope there's ice on all the roads!
And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt!
And again when your head goes through the windshield!

And everyone's caught on to (And I can't let you)
Everything you do (Let me down again)
Everyone's caught on to (And I can't let you)

It's hard to walk through all the places
That your life used to be in
So you thought you'd shed a layer
Maybe try on some new skin
Your friends are all imaginary
Your shrink stopped answering her phone
So you decide to make incisions
At your home while you're alone, all alone

But you're no tailor, you're no surgeon
None of your cuts go very straight
Every new layer you uncover
Reveals something else you hate
And then you cracked your head
And broke some bones
And when you glued them back together
You found out you did it wrong

Well, this is the same logic
That got us into trouble the first time
(When we discovered we could use) the same logic
To get us out of trouble
 
and shake off all the people we abuse
I don't need to know where you come from
If you don't know where you belong


So how's it feel to walk around
Like you're some sort of freak?
You're just a monster in bad costume
A shade of what you used to be

And you've got your kind of brand new face on
Where all the skin's pulled thin and taut
And every kid you see starts crying
So you stop going out for walks
Well, I guess nothing can be perfect
So here's a comforting thought:
At the bottom of the ocean
Fish won't judge you by your faults
 (Judge you by your faults)

Well, this is the same logic
That got us into trouble the first time
(When we discovered we could use) the same logic
To get us out of trouble and shake off all the people we abuse

If you don't know where you belong

So how's it feel to walk around

You're just a lobster in a mermaid costume
A shade of what you used to be


Goddamnit, you look so lovely
But you sound, you sound, you sound so ugly
Well, goddamnit, you look so lovely
But you sound, you sound, you sound so ugly
Well, goddamnit, you look so lovely
But you sound, you sound, you sound so ugly
Well, goddamnit, you look so lovely
But you sound, you sound, you sound so ugly

Keep the noise low
She doesn't wanna blow it
Shaking head to toe while your left hand does ""the show me around""
Quickens your heartbeat
It beats me straight into the ground
You don't recover from a night like this
A victim, still lying in bed, completely motionless
A hand moves in the dark to a zipper
Hear a boy bracing tight against sheets
, 
barely whisper
""This is so messed up""
Upon arrival the guests had all stared
Dripping wet and clearly depressed, he'd headed straight for the stairs
No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch
Unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships

He keeps his hands low (Up the stairs)
He doesn't wanna blow it
 (The station where)
He's wet from head to toe and his eyes give her the up and the down
His stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up (The act becomes)
But the body on the bed beckons forward and he starts growing up (The art of growing up)

The fever, the focus
The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell
Die young and save yourself
The tickle, the taste of
It used to be the reason I breathed but now it's choking me up
Die young and save yourself


She hits the lights
This doesn't seem quite fair
Despite everything he learned from his friends he doesn't feel so prepared
She's breathing quiet and smooth
He's gasping for air
""This is the first and last time,"" he says
She fakes a smile and presses her hips into his
And keeps his hands pinned down at his sides
He's holding back from telling her exactly what it really feels like
He is the lamb, she is the slaughter
She's moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her
Nothing that he tells her is really having an effect
He whispers that he loves her
 
but she's probably only looking for s--

So much more than he could ever give
 (Up the stairs)
A life free of lies and a meaningful relationship
 (The station where)
He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides (The act becomes)
He waits for it to end and for the aching in his guts to subside
 (The art of growing up)

The fever, the focus
The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell
Die young and save yourself
The tickle, the taste of
It used to be the reason I breathed but now it's choking me up
Die young and save yourself

The act becomes the art of growing up

I am heaven sent
Don't you dare forget
I am all you've ever wanted
What all the other boys all promised
Sorry I told
I just needed you to know
I think in decimals and dollars
I am the cause to all your problems
Shelter from cold
We are never alone
Coordinate brain and mouth
Then ask me what it's like to have myself so figured out

I hope this song starts a craze
The kinda song that ignites the airwaves
The kinda song that makes people glad to be where they are
With whoever they're there with
This is war
Every line is about who I don't wanna write about anymore
Hope you come down with something they can't diagnose
Don't have the cure for
Holding on to your grudge

And keeping quiet is hard
'Cause you can't keep a secret

We are entirely smooth
We admit to the truth
We are the best at what we do
And these are the words you wish you wrote down
This is the way you wish your voice sounds
Handsome and smart
Oh, my tongue's the only muscle on my body
That works harder than my heart
And it's all from watching TV
And from speeding up my breathing
Wouldn't stop if I could
Oh, it hurts to be this good
You're holding on to your grudge
Oh, it hurts to always have to be
Honest with the one that you love
Oh, so let it go

This is the rise and the fall!

Under the ocean
Next to a boiling vent
He's none the wiser
Earth's only resident
It piled up
Man, it was wall to wall
Blink of an eye
And all the problems solved

Let's all go play Nagasaki
We can all get vaporised
Hold my hand, let's turn to ash
I'll see you on the other side

Hey it’s D1
I don’t know why it’s been so crazy... I haven’t gotten any letters from you in the last 2 days... I guess the mail kind of screwed up too...when the both of us get here it always is... If there wasn’t a war going on this place would be pretty nice

When you were all alone

Open the gates
And then conceal the path

Oh, there, goes another round I gotta- uh, go to a bunker now""

Let's go ring and run the bunkers

Let's watch them scream across the sky
Let's all go and meet our maker
They don't care whose side you're on
We're so afraid, I prayed and prayed
Before I learned to love the bomb

They won’t send you over to the side you’re not—He’s… he’s brave and he’s always going to that bunker, so don’t worry about him... No I’m not, there’s just not much more to say... Give my love to your parents and to my parents... I’ll send them a few things as soon as I get to where I’m going to—Soon I’ll be back home with my love, soon...I’ll be...But yeah... P.S. Duke, I love you


Let's all go play Nagasaki
What a lovely way to die
A final show and we all go
So no one has to say goodbye

We're so afraid, I prayed and prayed
When God told me to love the bomb","Under the ocean Next to a boiling vent He's none the wiser Earth's only resident It piled up Man, it was wall to wall Blink of an eye And all the problems solved Let's all go play Nagasaki We can all get vaporised Hold my hand, let's turn to ash I'll see you on the other side Hey it’s D1 Before the garden When you were all alone You made the atom Was that some inside joke Open the gates And then conceal the path Let's load the gun And see how long they last “There goes the siren again Let's go ring and run the bunkers Baby won't you come outside? Across the sea the birds are free Let's watch them scream across the sky Let's all go and meet our maker They don't care whose side you're on We're so afraid, I prayed and prayed Before I learned to love the bomb Let's all go play Nagasaki What a lovely way to die A final show and we all go So no one has to say goodbye Let's all go and meet our maker Won't matter whose side you're on We're so afraid, I prayed and prayed When God told me to love the bomb"

With one or two, I get used to the room
We go slow when we first make our moves
By five or six, bring you out to the car
Number nine with my head on the bar
And it's sad but true, out of cash and IOUs
I got desperate desires and unadmirable plans
My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent
Bring you back to the bar, get you out of the cold
My sober, straight face gets you out of your clothes
And they're scared that we know all the crimes they'll commit
Who they'll kiss before they get home

I will lie awake and lie for fun
And fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say

Barely conscious in the door where you stand
Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands
You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute
I almost feel sorry for what I'm gonna do
And your hair smells of smoke
Who will cast the first stone?
You can sin or spend the night all alone
Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone
You're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start
If you let me have my way, I swear, I'll tear you apart
'Cause it's all you can be
You're a drunk, and you're scared
It's ladies night, all the girls drink for free


I will lie awake and lie for fun
And fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say

“
Scream in there.
”

“
AHHHHHH!
”

You and I are stuck in the waste
Was talking about our salad days, what a damn lie
But you and I are stuck like glue
And that's the goddamn truth, baby, bye-bye

Well, you could turn to water and we'd all float on
And give up trying to be someone
Take your head apart
Free your own heart
You and I are stuck out of phase
Always begging for some grace
When there's no time
We get no reply

Well, every night you were tripping out
And in the morning you were coming down
If it's breaking your heart, if nothing is fun
Well, don't lose hope, my son, this is the last one


You and I repent of our sins
Yeah, we feel so American laying in the road
Was a shoe-in for the crash of the day
And we're never going to walk away, we're never going home

I'm hoping that in time, you can lay down
All this weight you've been carrying around
And maybe one day
You find your way
To climb on up out of your grave
With the bits of you you managed to save
And for the last time
They say goodbye

Every night you were tripping out
And in the morning you were coming down
If it's breaking your heart, if nothing is fun
Well, don't lose hope, my son, this is the last one
'Cause every night had you laid low
It's going to feel so good to let it go
And it's all in your head, your race is run
Well, don't give up, my son, this is the last one
This is the last one


You are not alone, you are not alone
You are not alone, you get to reset
You are not alone, you are not alone
You are not alone, you get to reset

Every night you were tripping out
And in the morning you were coming down
If it's breaking your heart, if nothing is fun

When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them, your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade""
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?""

Sometimes, I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times, I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it


A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So 
paint it black
 
and take it back, and let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end, we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, ha, ha)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, ha, ha)
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
And give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
Just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
Just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care


We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, you'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart

They're gonna clean up your looks with all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work, they're gonna give you a smirk
'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine

They said, ""All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed""
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

The boys and girls in the clique, the awful names that they stick
You're never gonna fit in much, kid
But if you're troubled and hurt, what you got under your shirt
Will make them pay for the things that they did

Well, if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say
I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way

For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?

I'm not okay, I'm not okay, hey hey, hey
I'm not okay, hey, hey
You wear me out

What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems?
 
(
I'm not okay
)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words, but don't know what it means
 
(
I'm not okay
)

To be a joke 
and, look, another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look


I'm not okay, I'm not okay, hey, hey, hey
I'm not okay, hey, hey
You wear me out


Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed now

But I'm okay, I'm okay
I'm okay now, (
I'm okay now
), but you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay

Well, when you go
Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay
And maybe when you get back
I'll be off to find another way

And after all this time that you still owe
You're still a good-for-nothing, I don't know
So take your gloves and get out
Better get out while you can

When you go, and would you even turn to say
""I don't love you like I did yesterday""?

Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby, when they knock you down and out
Is where you oughta stay

And after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up while you can, whoa, whoa, whoa


When you go, and would you even turn to say
""I don't love you like I did yesterday""?

See the man who stands upon the hill
He dreams of all the battles won
But fate had left its scars upon his face
With all the damage they had done

And so time with age
It turns the page
Let the flesh
Submit itself to gravity

Let our bodies lay, mark our hearts with shame
Let our blood in vain, you find God in pain
Now, if your convictions were a passing faith
May your ashes feed the river in the morning rays
And as the vermin crawls
We lay in the foundations of decay

He was there, the day the towers fell
And so he wandered down the road
And we would all build towers of our own
Only to watch the roots corrode


But it's much too late
You're in the race
So we'll press
And press 'til you can't take it anymore

Let our bodies lay, mark our hearts with shame
Let our blood in vain, you find God in pain
And if, by his own hand, his spirit flies
Take his body as a relic to be canonized, now
And so he gets to die a saint
But she will always be the whore

(
You look stressed out!
)
Against faith (Cage all the animals)
Against all life ('Cause the message must be pure)
Against change (You can wander through the ruins)
We are plagued (But the poison is the cure)

You must fix your heart
And you must build an altar where it swells
When the storm it gains, and the sky it rains
Let it flood, let it flood, let it wash away
And as you stumble through your last crusade
Will you welcome your extinction in the morning rays?
And as the 
swarm
 
it calls,
 
we lay in the foundations

Well, I was there on the day they sold the cause for the queen
And when the lights all went out, we watched our lives on the screen
I hate the ending myself, but it started with an alright scene

It was the roar of the crowd that gave me heartache to sing
It was a lie when they smiled and said, ""You won't feel a thing""
And as we ran from the cops, we laughed so hard, it would sting
Yeah, yeah, woah

So wrong, so wrong

About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong

So I could watch all my heroes sell a car on TV
Bring out the old guillotine, we'll show 'em what we all mean

Dead! Lyrics
On “Dead!” Gerard Way takes on the roles of Mother War, The Patient, and the doctor, setting up the rest of the album to be a journey through The Patient’s final two weeks of battling cancer.

Yeah


And if your heart stops beating
I'll be here wondering
Did you get what you deserve?
The ending of your life

And if you get to Heaven
I'll be here waiting, babe
Did you get what you deserve?
The end, and if your life won't wait
Then your heart can't take this

Have you heard the news that you're dead?
No one ever had much nice to say
I think they never liked you anyway
Oh, take me from the hospital bed
Wouldn't it be grand? It ain't exactly what you planned
And wouldn't it be great if we were dead?


Oh, 
dead

Tongue-tied and oh, so squeamish
You never fell in love
Did you get what you deserve?
The ending of your life

And if you get to Heaven
I'll be here waiting, babe
Did you get what you deserve?
The end, and if your life won't wait
Then your heart can't take this

Have you heard the news that you're dead?
No one ever had much nice to say
I think they never liked you anyway
Oh, take me from the hospital bed
Wouldn't it be grand to take a pistol by the hand?
And wouldn't it be great if we were dead?

And in my honest observation, during this operation
Found a complication in your heart, so long
'Cause now you've got
Maybe just two weeks to live
Is that the most the both of you can give?



One, two, one, two, three, four
La la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la la la, well, come on
La la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la la la, oh, motherfucker

Well, it rains and it pours when you're out on your own
If I crash on the couch, can I sleep in my clothes?
'Cause I've spent the night dancing, I'm drunk, I suppose
If it looks like I'm laughing, I'm really just askin' to leave
This alone, you're in time for the show
You're the one that I need, I'm the one that you loathe
You can watch me corrode like a beast in repose
'Cause I love all the poison, away with the boys in the band

I've really been
On a bender, and it shows
So why don't you blow me
A kiss before she goes?

Give me a shot to remember
And you can take all the pain away from me
Your kiss, and I will surrender
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
A light to burn all the empires
So bright, the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all of these vampires
So you can leave like the sane abandoned me


There's a place in the dark where the animals go
You can take off your skin in the cannibal glow
Juliet loves the beat and the lust it commands
Drop the dagger and lather the blood on your hands, Romeo

I've really been

Let's go

I kissed the scars on her skin
I still think you're beautiful
And I don't ever want to lose my best friend
I screamed out, ""God, you vulture
Bring her back or take me with her""
Tear it down, break the barricade
I wanna see what sound it makes
I hate this flavor with a passion
And I fucking hate the aftertaste
How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel? Well, it feels like I'm on fire
Wake up, I know you can hear me

Make me a promise here tonight, love like a tidal wave
Dreamless in early graves, I never want it to be this way
The chemicals will bring you home again (Again)
This is it, when it's done, we can say that
When it's sudden death, we fight back

Oh, yeah (This was just as I suspected)
Pretend like I don't entice you
I've seen you circling the sky above my head
You traitor,
 I will never be taken for granted again
Keep digging holes in the desert
Say a prayer for you, I know that you're in pain
But if we die at the same time, does it still scare you?


Make me a promise here tonight (Let's go)
Dreamless in early graves, I never want it to be this way
The chemicals will bring you home again (Again)
This is it, when it's done, we can say that
Oh my god, we're not gonna make it

We will bring the tidal wave
We will bring the tidal wave
We will bring the tidal wave
We will bring the tidal wave
We will bring the tidal wave
We will bring the tidal wave
We will bring the tidal wave
And nothing will remain
She's mine
You stay away from her, it's not her time
'Cause, baby, I'm the one who haunts her dreams at night
Until she's satisfied

Make me a promise here tonight, love like a tidal wave
Dreamless in early graves (Early graves), I never want it to be this way

[Verse 1: Vic Fuentes & 
Kellin Quinn
]
Dare me to jump off of this Jersey bridge
I bet you never had a Friday night like this
Keep it up, keep it up, let's raise our hands
I take a look up at the sky, and I see red
Red for the cancer, red for the wealthy
Red for the drink that's mixed with suicide
Everything red

Please won't you push me for the last time?
Let's scream until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore
The thought of you's no fuckin' fun
You want a martyr? I'll be one
Because enough's enough, we're done

You told me, ""Think about it,"" well, I did (I did)
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of beggin' for the things that I want
I'm over sleepin' like a dog on the floor

Yeah!


The thing I think I love will surely bring me pain
Intoxication, paranoia, and a lot of fame
Three cheers for throwing up
, pubescent drama queen
You make me sick, I make it worse by drinkin' late

Scream, scream, scream, scream
Scream, scream
 until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want to anymore
The thought of you's no fuckin' fun
You want a martyr? I'll be one
Because enough's enough, we're done
[Chorus: Vic Fuentes & 
Kellin Quinn

You told me, ""Think about it,"" well, I did 
(Well, I did)
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of beggin' for the things that I want
I'm over sleepin' like a dog on the floor
Imagine livin' like a king someday
A single night without a ghost in the walls
And
 if the bass shakes the earth underground
We'll start a new revolution now
Now!

Alright, here we go


Hail Mary, forgive me
Blood for blood, hearts beating (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Come at me, now this is war (Oh-oh-oh)
Fuck with this new beat, oh
[Breakdown: Vic Fuentes & 
Kellin Quinn
]
Now terror begins inside a bloodless vein
I was just a product of the street youth rage
Born in this world without a voice or say
Caught in the spokes with an abandoned brain
I know you well, but this ain't a game
Blow the smoke in diamond shape
Dying is a gift, so close your eyes and rest in peace
[Chorus: Vic Fuentes & 
Kellin Quinn

Caraphernelia Lyrics

Sunshine
There ain't a thing that you can do that's gonna ruin my night
(But there's just something about)
This dizzy dreamer and her bleeding little blue boy
Licking your fingers like you're done and
You've decided there is so much more than me (Oh)
And, baby, honestly, it's harder breathing next to you, I shake
I brought a gun and as the preacher tried to stop me
Hold my heart, it's beating for you anyway
[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon & 
Vic Fuentes
]
What if I can't forget you? (
Oh
)
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
What's so good about picking up the pieces?
None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole
Oh

Nobody prays for the heartless (No)
Nobody gives another penny for the selfish
(You're learning how to taste what you kill now)
Don't mind me, I'm just reaching for your necklace
Talking to my mom about this little girl from Texas

[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon & 
Vic Fuentes
]
What if I can't forget you? (
Oh

I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you

Jeremy McKinnon
]
Just give her back to me
You know I can't afford the medicine that feeds what I need
So, baby, what if I can't forget you? (
What if I can't forget you?
)
Collide invisible lips like a shadow on the wall
And just throw, oh no
You can't just throw me away


So what if I can't forget you?
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
And what's so good about picking up the pieces?
What if I don't even want to?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

She sits up high, surrounded by the sun
One million branches and she loves everyone
""Mom and Dad, did you search for me?
I've been up here so long, I'm going crazy""

And as the sun went down
We ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows
You screamed over the sound
And as we own this night
I put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
Three, two, one, where did it go? (Oh)

Now don't be crazy, yes, now, of course you can stay here
Been in a touring band for going on ten years
""Big deal,"" she said, ""I guess you're official"" (Oh)
I only said it 'cause I know what it's like to feel burned out
It gets you down, we've all been there sometimes
But tonight, I'll make you feel beautiful once again

And as the sun went down
We ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows
You screamed over the sound
And as we own this night
I put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
Three, two, one, where did it go?

[Bridge: Vic Fuentes &

If I were you, I'd put that away
See, you're just wasted and thinking 'bout the past again
Darling, you'll be okay
And she said
""If you were me, you'd do the same
'Cause I can't take any more
I'll draw the shades and close the door
Everything's not alright and I would rather""

Bulletproof Love Lyrics

I'll breathe you in with smoke in the backyard light
We used to laugh until we choked, into the wasted nights
It was the best time of my life, but now I sleep alone
So don't, don't, don't wake me up, 'cause my thrill is gone
Say I'm wrong in the sunset turning red behind the smoke
Forever and alone
Yeah

And you've gone and sewn me to this bed
The taste of you and me will never leave my lips again
Under the blinding rain (Blinding rain)
I wanna hold your hand so tight, I'm gonna break my wrists (Break my wrists)
And when the vultures sing tonight, I'm gonna join right in

I'll sing along (Oh, oh, oh)
Because I don't know any other song, woah, oh, no
I'll sing along,
 
but I'm barely hanging on
No, I'm barely hanging on
By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone
And now there's nothing to do but scream at the drunken moon

This isn't fair (No)
Don't you try to blame this on me
My love for you was bulletproof, but you're the one who shot me
And goddammit, I can barely say your name
So, I'll try to write it and fill the pen with blood from the sink
Woah, oh
But, don't just say it, you should sing my name
Pretend that it's a song 'cause forever it's yours
And we can sing this on the way home


I'll sing along (Oh, oh, oh)
'Cause I don't know any other song, woah, oh, no
I'll sing along,
 
but I'm barely hanging on

Do you know
I count your heartbeats before you sleep?
I bite my fingernails to bone
And then I crawl back under the stairwell
To a place I call my home
I really hope you enjoy the show

I bite my fingernails to bone And then I crawl back under the stairwell To a place I call my home I really hope you enjoy the show Because for me, it's just a bad day You need people like me to feel Maybe we're just having too much fun Maybe you can't handle yourself Staring at me with your lips and tongue You'll never know I don't know where I'm going to sleep tonight But, oh, don't you threaten me with a good time Murder the moment, my God, I'm the serpent I'm sorry, I can't see that you truly love me Maybe we're just having too much fun Maybe you can't handle yourself Staring at me with your lips and tongue I've been having this dream that we can fly (Oh, alright) Please don't take this out on me ( I don't know how much longer I can stay here on this earth ) 'Cause you're the only thing that's keeping me alive ( I've lost all touch with everything and nothing seems to work ) ( ) I would rather end it all tonight And if I mean anything to you ( I don't deserve to be alive ) I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind Maybe we're just having too much fun Maybe you can't handle yourself Staring at me with your lips and tongue I've been having this dream that we can fly So darling, close your eyes 'Cause you're about to miss everything (About to miss everything) About to miss everything (About to miss everything)"

Rage in us, your thirst I'm taking
Pull the plug

shaking
And thrustin' about your apartment
Drowned on the blankets,
 
floral and fading
, huh
Painful lust, two aching guts
They tear through each other in the mirror
This happy vacation, there's no motivation
To hold me up

You say you want to chase the moon like fire
Well, together we can fake our own deaths here
Just wanna be alone and watch as you all just disappear
(Whoa-oh-ooh, oh, oh-oh-oh)

D-d-d-darker now, 
kicked out and sleeping in your car
You roll the window down (Oh-oh)
Enough to dream and make-believe
Our lights knocked out, turned upside down
And I'm just a stupid motherfucker, can't figure it out
I want devil horns
, I wanna breathe in your rush
I wanna leap when you want me to fly
But darling, I don't mean to beg (Oh-whoa-oh, oh)
But these thorns on the stem are nearly tearing up my skin


And now you wanna chase the moon like fire
Well, together we can fake our own deaths here
Just wanna be alone and watch as you all just disappear

Tony!

(Oh, oh-oh-oh)

Close your eyes
Picture you and I
Selling daylight
For gasoline

So now we're gonna chase the moon like fire, yeah
Together we can fake our own deaths here

Hell Above Lyrics

Cannot spend another night in this home
I close my eyes and take a breath real slow
The consequence is if I leave, I'm alone
But what's the difference when you beg for love?
'Cause I run through glass in the street
Kerosene hearts carry
 
the name that my father gave me
And take the face of the wolf

'Cause this is a wasteland, my only retreat
With heaven above you, there's hell over me

I met a girl who never looked so alone
Like sugar water in your mouth lukewarm
She tied a cherry stem for me with her tongue
We fell in love and now we're both alone
'Cause I don't need any more friends
And another kiss like a fire on pavement
We'll burn it down 'til the end
Oh, oh

This is a wasteland, my only retreat
With heaven above you, there's hell over me
The water is rusted, the air is unclean
And there for a second, I feel free
This is a wasteland, my only retreat


I've waited all this night to honor you and say
""I know it's hard, but who are you to fall apart on me, on me?""

This is a wasteland, my only retreat
With heaven above you, there's hell over me
'Cause this is a wasteland, my only retreat
With heaven above you, there's hell over me
You said what about us, well what about me?
Hang from the gallows, asleep in the rain
This is a wasteland, my only retreat

Choke, tried to wash you down with something strong
Tried, but the taste of blood remains (Taste of blood remains)
Cold, empty mattresses and falling stars
My, how they start to look the same

So keep in happiness and torture me

A million hooks around, a million ways to die
Darling, it's cold outside

No, no more eyes to see the sun (To see the sun)
You slide into bed while I get drunk
Slow conversations with a gun mean more
Than I've ever said to anyone, anyone

So keep in happiness and torture me
While I tell you

A million hooks around, a million ways to die
Darling, let's go inside,

But last night
You said you ended up in Palm Springs dancing on tables
Almost fought some bitch at the club (Yeah!)
Got kicked out of your hotel and lost your shoes
Well, fuck, what, am I supposed to be impressed?
You're just another set of bones to lay to rest
I guess it's time to say goodnight
Hope you had a really good time
Good time


But I will soon forget the color of your eyes
And you'll forget mine

Baby, pour over
Tell me, are we concrete?
What would you do without my perfect company to your undressed spine?
And I can hear you drag behind my car by your broken legs
Swallowing stitches in her sleep
As she stole my only view, may I never blink

While you stood over the pavement
I was biting the curb
Sick entertainment
But I'll bet it feels good coming down
Can't bear to wash out the wasted time
Between your lips and mine

Zero friends
Followed your voices into a sea of crosses
She blends in with the foxes gold and feels like home
Under the surface, my love
But beware, beware, beware
And take it slow tonight
We're on the other side of the road
I think we're bleeding out


While you stood over the pavement
I was biting the curb
Sick entertainment
But I'll bet it feels good coming down
Can't bear to wash out the wasted time
Between our lips
So c'mon and swing it back and forth just like
My heart is on a pendulum tonight
If your lungs are mine I only wanna watch your clouds linger in the darkness

Oh, can't you feel it?
You're feeding on my restless soul
Oh, can't you see that
It's never enough, it's never enough
Oh, can't you feel it?
You feed on my restless soul
Oh, can you see that
It's never enough, it's never enough
Today I saw the whole world
And I think heaven has a plot to take my life
Listen, I'm the one who made you
I'll be the one who brings you down
But this will be the last time


Bite on the curb
Aw, your sick entertainment
Oh, I'll bet it feels good when you're coming down

Besitos Lyrics
Besitos is a story written from the point of view of Vic’s ex-lover. Vic takes advantage of her emotionally to the point of her getting fed up and seeking revenge. Besito is Spanish for “little kisses”

You're my favorite explosion
(You know the only real way to cure pain is to add a little more)
(Because everything new distracts the old)

A violin with no hands plays
Symphonies with no words (With no words)
A drowning boy with no voice prays
Someone up there's telling me
""You'd better not get back up""
I spit my heart into this red cup
I'd better pick it back up, it might ruin your night (Ruin your night)
And she said
[Pre-Chorus: Vanessa Harris, 
Vanessa Harris & Vic Fuentes
]
""Baby, leave the water by the bed for later""
I woke up without a single drop

I told myself
""I'm tired of holding up your backup plans""
Go down your list and be satisfied
If all you have is not enough

(True love comes from more than just the heart)
She said paint a picture on me
Throw your dress up and your heart away
Yeah, I heard what you said (No), a friend of a friend
These strangers at the party never paid
And if that doesn't turn you on
I'll keep talking 'til something does
As we're covered in sand, you roll over and smile (Smile, smile)


I told myself
""I'm tired of holding up your backup plans""
Go down your list and be satisfied
It's all you have

And until that day (That day)
I'll steal you flowers from the cemetery, red roses
Red rose of the dead
How does it feel to breathe oxygen inside her head?

So say it (Say it, say), say ""I'm in love""
'Cause you called me crying (Crying), crying (Crying) from your job
Said you just got fired and you don't have a backup plan
So don't expect me to understand
A diamond bullet and a gun made of gold
She was covered in blood, last seen in San Francisco

Yeah, alright
(We all break down)
Sometimes the bedroom walls become my only friends
But they were there from beginning to end
(There from beginning to end)


I'm tired of holding up your backup plans
Go down your list and be satisfied
It's all you have

You know I've never held a gun in my life
But now I carry one around in case I see you tonight
Bedroom walls, oh, these bedroom walls
Oh, I hate what it tastes like

Disasterology Lyrics

Alright

I laid down, I drank the poison and then I passed the fuck out
Now let me tell you 'bout the good life
I have a million different kinds of fun
When I'm asleep and in a dream that I'm your only one

Can we create something beautiful and destroy it? (Destroy it?)
Nobody knows I dream about it ('Bout it)
This is my imagination

If you come over tonight, we can travel through time
We can sleep on the ceiling and creep under black lights
I have a million different girls that hide
Under my bed and when I let them out they treat me right
Oh, what a waste of a perfectly good, clean wrist
You were screaming 'til the police came

Can we create something beautiful and destroy it? (Destroy it?)
Nobody knows I dream about it ('Bout it)
This is my imagination
If every living thing dies alone
What am I doing here?
If every living thing dies alone
What am I doing here?
(Oh, fuck it!)


If it's the end of the world
If it's the end of the world
You and me should spend the rest of it in love

Dive in, take a breath
Blow the smoke through the hole in my chest
Still choking on the bed
Found your waste while the ember red
Keeps falling down and burning holes
Until the pillow and the mattress glow
Now I wanna be the tattoo ink
That swims down through the needle in your skin
And I wish I was poisonous
Like a bottomless sound, like a violent drug
Do you remember the knife I kept?
The sharper it got, the more you wanted me to use it
I was lying to you (Oh), but you were lying too
So what's left to do?
What's left to say?
Stop making friends, just us
I'll decompose with you
So light the fuse inside your brain and we
We will detonate
 (Yeah)

You threw your drink at the wall
It started raining wine and glass, so
Stay and warm me with the Gentlemen Jack
Gold locks on the cage, turn your diamond keys
Open the door, you'll see me digging out my getaway (Away, away, away)
Hang the stars
Who pulled the pin out of my heart?


And just because you're screaming for my attention
Does not mean I will waste my time
So hold your breath and swim under the ice

And modern anxiety
That motherfucker never rests
Our adrenaline is kickin' in, so play the beat faster
Head for the streets (Ah), we're the puke and decay
(We're only dreaming, what's your problem, baby?)
Don't mean to break your heart, I'm the new fragrance in fermented jars
In area code 666, oh

And just because you're screaming for my attention
Does not mean I will waste my time
So hold your breath and learn how to swim underneath the ice

They're everywhere
Nothing can stop them
Nothing

Kill me if I end up like you


And just because you're screaming for my attention
Does not mean I will waste my time
So hold your breath and swim under the ice

I know that it's not safe here
You did this to yourself, but have no fear
Just hold your breath and swim under",https://genius.com/Pierce-the-veil-dive-in-lyrics,"Dive in, take a breath

And modern anxiety
That motherfucker never rests
(We're only dreaming, what's your problem, baby?)
Don't mean to break your heart, I'm the new fragrance in fermented jars
In area code 666, oh
And just because you're screaming for my attention
Does not mean I will waste my time
They're everywhere
Nothing can stop them
Nothing
Kill me if I end up like you
And just because you're screaming for my attention
Does not mean I will waste my time
I know that it's not safe here
Just hold your breath and swim under","Dive in, take a breath Still choking on the bed Found your waste while the ember red Keeps falling down and burning holes Until the pillow and the mattress glow Now I wanna be the tattoo ink And I wish I was poisonous Like a bottomless sound, like a violent drug Do you remember the knife I kept? I was lying to you (Oh), but you were lying too So what's left to do? What's left to say? Stop making friends, just us I'll decompose with you We will detonate (Yeah) You threw your drink at the wall It started raining wine and glass, so Stay and warm me with the Gentlemen Jack Hang the stars Who pulled the pin out of my heart? And just because you're screaming for my attention Does not mean I will waste my time And modern anxiety That motherfucker never rests (We're only dreaming, what's your problem, baby?) Don't mean to break your heart, I'm the new fragrance in fermented jars In area code 666, oh And just because you're screaming for my attention Does not mean I will waste my time They're everywhere Nothing can stop them Nothing Kill me if I end up like you And just because you're screaming for my attention Does not mean I will waste my time I know that it's not safe here Just hold your breath and swim under"

She Makes Dirty Words Sound Pretty Lyrics

If you call me at all
Don't tell me that I'm ordinary
'Cause I won't be passing you, please don't leave
And if you tell me you're listening to everything you read

Turn off this light, call my name
Don't talk, just ride
Who wouldn't let you be all about
About me
I'm only trying to work this out

So if you call me at all
Don't tell me that I'm ordinary
'Cause I won't be passing you, please don't leave
And if you tell me you're listening to everything you read
If you call me at all...

Oh,I hear you breathing on the line
Oh, baby girl, 
I'm not your type
I leave you hurting every night
So I won't be coming back
Who wouldn't let me be all alone?
Who wouldn't let me be all alone?
Who wouldn't let you scream ohh into a soft pillow?

[Bridge: Vic Fuentes & 
Jonny Craig

Stay Away from My Friends Lyrics

Waking up your neighbors downstairs
I've been inside your bedroom a thousand years
And as you tie me to the bed for good, I say
That I want you in the most unromantic ways
Louisiana, you're torturing me with a beautiful face
Ana, come on, I thought we had a damn good thing (Damn good thing)
A penny in the couch and a diamond ring

So, baby, stay away from my friends
'Cause I need them to carry me
When it's over, I'll count back from ten
And you can listen to glass hearts shattering

I don't know how you get into me
Down my throat and made a home in my veins
They used to be the rivers that would take us away
Now you only call me every Christmas and my birthday
I still can't believe how you look next to me
Just like a strip club bedroom scene

Baby, stay away from my friends (My friends)
'Cause I need them to carry me
When it's over, I'll count back from ten
And you can listen to something that you've never heard before


Oh, woah, oh, woah (Never heard before)
Oh, woah, oh, woah
Oh, woah, oh, woah
Oh, woah, oh, woah
Oh, woah, oh, woah (Never heard before)
Oh, woah, oh, woah
Oh, woah, oh, woah

But you don't know what it's like
To wake up in the middle of the night
Scaring the thought of kissing razors
This blood evacuation is telling me to cave in
Stay away (Away), oh no, no
Oh no
Just stay away (Away) from my friends (From my friends)
Away, away, away
Away, away, away",https://genius.com/Pierce-the-veil-stay-away-from-my-friends-lyrics,"Waking up your neighbors downstairs

Met a girl at seventeen
Thought she meant the world to me
So I gave her everything
She turned out to be a cheat
Said she'd been thinkin' for a long time
And she found somebody new
I've been thinkin' that this whole time
Girl, I never thought you'd stay, that's okay
I hope he takes your filthy heart and then he throws you away someday
Before you go, there's one thing you oughta know

If you can't hang then there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then there's the door

I-I-I don't wanna take your precious time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time
I-I-I don't wanna take up all your time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time


You're the lowest type
You're the lowest

I met a girl stuck in her ways
She found a boy she knew she'd change
I changed my clothes, my hair, my faith
To watch us go our separate ways
She said we've grown apart for some time
But then she found somebody new
I hope Mr. Right puts up with all the bullshit that you do
Stay the hell away
While I sit here by myself and figure out how I got this way
Before you go, there's one thing you oughta know

If you can't hang then there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then there's the door

I-I-I don't wanna take your precious time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time
I-I-I don't wanna take up all your time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time


I don't want to get things confused
She said she'd never settle for some boy she couldn't use
So now I gotta call the doctor so he can prescribe me medication
So I can deal with all the memories of being here this way

I met a girl at twenty-three
Knew she meant the world to me
So I gave her everything
And she did the same for me

Stay for tonight if you want to
I can show you what my dreams are made of
As I'm dreamin' of your face
I've been away for a long time
Such a long time, and I miss you there
I can't imagine bein' anywhere else
I can't imagine bein' anywhere else but here
(Oh, ooh)

How the hell did you ever pick me?
Honestly, I could sing you a song
But I don't think words can express your beauty
It's singing to me
How the hell did we end up like this?
You bring out the beast in me
I fell in love from the moment we kissed
Since then, we've been history

They say that love is forever
Your forever is all that I need (It's all that I need)
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave (I will never leave)
Please stay forever with me


It goes to show, I hope that you know that you are
What my dreams are made of
Can't fall asleep, can't fall asleep
I lie in my bed awake, in my bed awake at night

I'll fall in love, you'll fall in love
It could mean everything, everything to me

Your forever is all that I need (It's all that I need)
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave (I will never leave)
Please stay forever with me

The way that we are is the reason I stay
As long as you're here with me, I know I'll be okay
The way that we are is the reason I stay
As long as you're here with me, I know I'll be okay

They say that love is forever
Your forever is all that I need (It's all that I need)
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave (I will never leave)

She says she wants to end it all when she's all alone in her room
She cries
The way she feels inside is too much for her
When all you got is these four walls
It's not that hard to feel so small
Or even exist at all
How come no one heard her when she said

Maybe I'm better off dead
If I was would it finally be enough
To shut out all those voices in my head?
Maybe I'm better off dead
Better off dead!
Did you hear a word
Hear a word I said?
This is not where I belong
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gone, gone
This is not where I belong
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

She doesn't know she's beautiful
Because no one's ever told her so
And the demons that she has is all she knows
And maybe she can fall in love with someone in her life that she could trust
And tell her she's enough (Have someone tell her she's enough)
How come no one heard her when she said


Maybe I'm better off dead
If I was would it finally be enough
To shut out all those voices in my head?
Maybe I'm better off dead
Better off dead!
Did you hear a word
Hear a word I said?
This is not where I belong
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gone, gone
This is not where I belong
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

When all you got is these four walls
It's not hard to feel so small
When all you got is these four walls
It's not hard to feel so small
All she wanted was to be enough

Father, father, 
tell me, where have you been?

It's been hell not having you here
I've been missing you so bad
And you don't seem to care
When I go to sleep at night, you're not there
When I go to sleep at night, do you care?

Do you even miss us?
Your bottles, your mistress
I need to know, I need to know

Why are you walking away?
Was it something I did?
 
Did I make a mistake?
'Cause I'm trying to deal with the pain
I don't understand this, is this how it ends?

I will try to understand

You're skipping town with no note telling where

Why are you running away?

Why are you running away?
Tell me please, tell me please, I need to know

Is this what you call a family?
Is this what you call a family?
Is this what you call a family?
Is this what you call a family?

I can't believe a damn thing they say anymore
Lie! Lie! Liar!
Liar, you'll pay for your sins

Stay for tonight
If you want to
I can show you
What my dreams are made of
As I'm dreaming of your face
I've been away for a long time
Such a long time
And I miss you there
I can't imagine being anywhere else
I can't imagine being anywhere else but here

How the hell did you ever pick me?
Honestly, cause I could sing you a song
But I don't think words can express your beauty
It's singing to me
How the hell did we end up like this?
You bring out the beast in me
I fell in love from the moment we kissed
Since then we've been history

They say that love is forever
Your forever is all that I need
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave
Please stay forever with me


(If you want to, I can show you.)
(If you want to, I can show you.)

It goes to show, I hope that you know that you are
What my dreams are made of
And I can't fall asleep
I lay in my bed awake at nights
And I'll fall in love, you'll fall in love
It could mean everything, everything to me
Ooh This could mean everything to me

They say that love is forever
Your forever is all that I need
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave
Please stay forever with

The way that we are
Is the reason I stay
As long as you're here with me
I know I'll be okay


They say that love is forever
Your forever is all that I need
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave

Woah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Could you check my pulse for me to see if I'm alive?
'Cause every time that I am near you is the only time I feel alright (Woah)
If there were any way I could think to turn back time (Woah)
I'd stay here with you (You, you, you)
Sometimes I sit and wonder, sometimes I feel like letting go
All I know is no one should have to be alone, woah

I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna die alone (No one should have to die alone)
I could fall apart here and now
I don't wanna die alone

I wanna be with you, you, you (With you)
I only wanna be with you, you, you
(With you, with you, with you, with you) Uh, uh, uh

Tell me, what's the point of life, is it material?
Had everything I could ever want, and probably more
When I lay in bed at night, all I do is think of you
So when all this is gone, what do I have to come home to?
This life goes by so fast; pretty soon, I'll grow old
What would I have but some stories now that I have told?
No one to share them with, and when it's all done
What am I left with? Tell me, what's left?


I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna die alone (No one should have to die alone)
I could fall apart here and now
I don't wanna die alone (MGK)

Leave me? How the fuck you gon' leave me?
When I'm the one that's on TV
With these girls screaming outside with my CD
And I'm begging? Nah, baby, you're the one that can't keep me
Leave me? Girl, how the fuck you gon' leave me? Huh?
You know I love you, when we fight and we argue I kiss and I hug you
You push me back, you say that I'm trouble
But every Bonnie got a Clyde with her (Kells)
Every woman needs somebody that's gon' ride with her
Yeah, and I can't go on stayin' alive if I'm alone
Pick up the phone and say hello (Yeah, yeah), I'd rather die with her
Now my night's so cold
When your heart is frozen, mine's exposed, you know this
Tryna blame the fame for the way I've changed
And you know those claims are bogus
Baby, it's not me, it's us, maybe now all we need is trust
Maybe this Hennessey'll solve our problems, baby, pick it up

When you look at my life, tell me, what do you see?
I'm only human, so don't expect too much from me
I lost my faith, what have I become?
I don't think I can be safe from what I'm running from

Will you remember me
If I were to fall into the sky?
And what will they think of me
If I leave it all behind?
When I leave it all behind?

Would you be so surprised if I gave up tonight?
I'm barely breathing, I wanna kill the pain I feel inside
But I won't quit for the people I love
So I'll say I'm fine until the day I fucking see the light

Will you remember me
If I were to fall into the sky?
And what will they think of me
If I leave it all behind?
When I leave it all behind?


If you feel like you are nothing
If you feel like letting go
I'll be your hope when you are hopeless
Together, we are not alone
You're not alone

Will you remember me (Remember me)
If I were to fall into the sky? (Fall into the sky)
And what will they think of me (Think of me)

True friends lie underneath these witty words I don't believe
I can't believe a damn thing they say anymore
Lie, liar, you'll pay for your sins
Now, liar, I know all the places you've been, lie
Forgiveness, this taste all but poisons my mouth
I scream, but nothing, nothing will come out
(You've gone too far)

So tell me, how does it feel?
How does it feel to be like you?
I think your mouth should be quiet
'Cause it never tells the truth
So tell me, so tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?
Why can't things ever change?

Falling over and over again
Oh, why does it have to be this way?
From the place I was, to the place I am, to the place I want to be
For the mountains I've been climbing over and under and over
From the place that I was to the man I’ve become
I'll be there to see the tower you’ll fall from
No, this kingdom isn't quite what it may seem
You’re an illusion, you’ll never be king


So tell me, how does it feel?
How does it feel to be like you?
I think your mouth should be quiet
'Cause it never tells the truth
So tell me, so tell me why

Sometimes things are better left unsaid
But this time, you'll get what you give
(True friends lie underneath these witty words I don't believe
I can't believe a damn thing they say anymore)
Come down (Come down), come down from your tower
(Falling over and over again)
Come down (Come down), come down from your tower

Just open up like a page in a book
These words that I'm writing won't be misunderstood
If I'm dishonest, bring me back to my knees
Show me why I'm even able to speak
I'll testify, please help me to see
Don't close your eyes, keep your eyes on me
Open up, open up now (So make me strong)

There's blood on my hands, and the killer's not my enemy
It's all for the sake of love, it's all for you

When all we know is falling, I'll save something for you
You who are all alone (All alone)
When everything is beautiful, when everything's okay
Even if it's not okay, I'll say, ""It's all for you, for you, for you
For you (For you), for you (For you), for you and only you""

These hands hold up nothing but scars underneath (Scars underneath)
From swimming these oceans and learning to breathe (Learning to breathe)
So often I tell them, so often they listen to me

(And I'm hoping there's some way I can follow)
I know somehow there's something new
I've seen it so clearly
I can feel your hand on my fingertips

There's so many things that I could say
But I'm sure it would come out all wrong
You've got something that I can't explain
Still, I'll try and try and let you know
The first summer we spent's one will never forget
Looking for any kind of reason to escape all the mess
That we thought was what made us, ain't it funny now?
We can see, we're who we're meant to be

You still have all of my

You still have all my heart

Those late summers we spent, stay up talking all night

Every year that goes by, a year older we are
You'll still be beautiful then, bless your beautiful heart

Can't count the years on one hand that we've been together
I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park to love each other
But when our fingers interlock, can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

'Cause after all this time
I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And, baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time
I'm still into you

Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house, I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world fall off your shoulder

When I was younger, I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk


Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, oh

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

And I'm on my way to believing

Hit that, hit that snare

I'm in the business of misery
, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to 
who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse


Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

I watched his wildest dreams come true
And not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving


Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag

Think of me when you're out, when you're out there
I'll beg you nice from my knees
And when the world treats you way too fairly
Well, it's a shame I'm a dream

All I wanted was you

I think I'll pace my apartment a few times
And fall asleep on the couch
And wake up early to black-and-white reruns
That escape from my mouth
 (Oh, oh)

I could follow you to the beginning
Just to relive the start
And maybe then, we'd remember to slow down

So take a seat, we're settling the final score

'Cause I burned
Every bridge I ever built when you were here

Man, you really know how to get someone down
Everything was fine until you came around
And I've been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
After all, wasn't I the one who said
To keep your feet on the ground?
Man, you really brought me back down

Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
They say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

You got me tied up, but I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you say
When you gonna hear me out?
Man, you really bring me down

Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
They say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me


Reality will break your heart
Survival will not be the hardest part
It's keeping all your hopes alive
When all the rest of you has died
So let it break your heart

And, ooh, hearts are breakin' and wars are ragin' on

You got me nervous, I'm right at the end of my rope
A half-empty girl, don't make me laugh, I'll choke

And I bet everybody here is just as insincere

I'm quite alright, better hope I don't blink
You see, it's easy when I'm stompin' on a beat

I don't even know myself at all
I thought I would be happy by now
But the more I try to push it, I realize
Gotta let go of control

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Just let it happen

It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

Every night, I try my best to dream
Tomorrow makes it better
Then I wake up to the cold reality
And not a thing has changed

But it will happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen


It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

And the salt in my wounds
Isn't burning any more than it used to
It's not that I don't feel the pain
It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore
And the blood in these veins
Isn't pumping any less than it ever has
And that's the hope I have
The only thing I know is keeping me alive
Alive

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen


It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
 (So if I let go of control now, I can be strong)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
 (So if I keep my eyes closed with a blind hope)

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
And the salt in my wounds
Isn't burning any more than it used to
It's not that I don't feel the pain
It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore
And the blood in these veins
Isn't pumping any less than it ever has
And that's the hope I have
Alive
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
(So if I let go of control now, I can be strong)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
(So if I keep my eyes closed with a blind hope)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh","I don't even know myself at all I thought I would be happy by now Gotta let go of control Gotta let it happen Gotta let it happen Gotta let it happen Just let it happen It's just a spark, but it's enough To keep me going And when it's dark out, no one's around It keeps glowing Every night, I try my best to dream Tomorrow makes it better Then I wake up to the cold reality And not a thing has changed But it will happen Gotta let it happen Gotta let it happen Gotta let it happen It's just a spark, but it's enough To keep me going And when it's dark out, no one's around It keeps glowing It's just a spark, but it's enough To keep me going And when it's dark out, no one's around It keeps glowing And the salt in my wounds Isn't burning any more than it used to It's not that I don't feel the pain It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore And the blood in these veins Isn't pumping any less than it ever has And that's the hope I have Alive Gotta let it happen Gotta let it happen Gotta let it happen Gotta let it happen Gotta let it happen Gotta let it happen Gotta let it happen Gotta let it happen It's just a spark, but it's enough To keep me going (So if I let go of control now, I can be strong) And when it's dark out, no one's around It keeps glowing It's just a spark, but it's enough To keep me going (So if I keep my eyes closed with a blind hope) And when it's dark out, no one's around It keeps glowing Ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah Ooh, ooh, oh Ooh, ooh, ooh"

One, two, three, four

I am going away for a while
But I'll be back, don't try and follow me
'Cause I'll return as soon as possible
See, I'm trying to find my place
But it might not be here where I feel safe
We all learn to make mistakes

And run from them, from them
With no direction
We'll run from them, from them
With no conviction

'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
Traveling endlessly
Don't need no roads
In fact, they follow me
And we just go in circles

Now I'm told that this is life
And pain is just a simple compromise
So we can get what we want out of it
Would someone care to classify
Our broken hearts and twisted minds?
So I can find someone to rely on


And run to them, to them
Full speed ahead
Oh, you are not useless
We are just

Misguided ghosts
Traveling endlessly
The ones we trusted the most
Pushed us far away
And there's no one road
We should not be the same
But I'm just a ghost
And still they echo me
They echo me in circles",https://genius.com/Paramore-misguided-ghosts-lyrics,"Polski

If I'm a bad person, you don't like me
Well, I guess I'll make my own way
It's a circle, a mean cycle
I can't excite you anymore

What's my offense this time?
You're not a judge, but if you're gonna judge me
Well, sentence me to another life

When you swear it's all my fault
 
'cause you know we're not the same (No)
We're not the same (Oh)

But I guess you can't accept that the change is good (Hey)

Well, it's nice to meet you, sir, I guess I'll go

This is the best thing that could've happened
Any longer and I wouldn't have made it
It's not a war, no, it's not a rapture

The same tricks that, that once fooled me
They won't get you anywhere
I'm not the same kid from your memory

I'm gonna make it bend and break

Say a prayer, but let the good times roll
In case God doesn't show
(Let the good times roll, let the good times roll...)
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
""Who does he think he is?"" If that's the worst you've got
Better put your fingers back to the keys...

One night and one more time

Great,

They say we are what we are
But we don't have to be
I'm bad behavior, but I do it in the best way
I'll be the watcher (Watcher)
Of the eternal flame
I'll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass, glass (Glass)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I try to picture me without you, but I can't

'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now
And pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long

We could be immor—, immortals
Immor—, immortals
Immor—, immortals
Immor—, immortals


(Imm—, immortals)

Sometimes, the only payoff for having any faith
Is when it's tested again and again every day
I'm still comparing your past to my future
It might be your wound, but they're my sutures

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass, glass (Glass)

Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries

Hey-ya, oh, hey, hey-ya
Remember me for centuries

Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story's all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match the darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Remember me for centuries

And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
'Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light
My shadow's over you
'Cause I, I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom, you're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

I've been waiting up 'cause I can't get enough, oh
I feel I'm fading (
Yeah

When I fall apart, your needle sews my heart, oh

Fuck me up and make me just go crazy
Addicted to the pain that you just made me love
I'm fiendin' for your touchin' on the daily
You're the only one that I want

Break my heart but don't tell me I'm not doin' fine
'Cause I'm doin' fine
Let me go, I'm spendin' time
Not doin' fine but I'm doin' fine

Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin'


I been dreamin'
Of your uniform, your uniform non-conformity
The tears, the tears
Tears aren't strong enough, the years aren't long enough, no

Fuck me up and make me just go crazy
Addicted to the pain that you just made me love
I'm fiendin' for your touchin' on the daily
You're the only one that I want

Break my heart but don't tell me I'm not doin' fine
'Cause I'm doin' fine
Let me go, I'm spendin' time
Not doin' fine but I'm doin' fine

Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain?

It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
I feel like I'm looking for somethin', somethin' that'll never come


Call me when you're in the city again
My head just went oblivion
It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
(Always on the tip of my tongue)
[Verse 4: iLoveMakonnen & 
Lil Peep
]
And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
Now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
When I've been waitin' (
I've been waitin'
)
Long for you (
Long for you
)

I wanna drink my wine, I wanna pass that by
I wanna make her cry, she wanna make me die
Apple pie, six cigarettes
And I'll catch the vibe that we can't forget

Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain?

It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
I feel like I'm looking for somethin', somethin' that'll never come

[Outro: Lil Peep &

I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
I'll be waiting (For you)

Just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay
Just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway
Just the first time ever hangin' out with you tonight
I've got my money on things goin' badly
Got a history of stories ending sadly
Still hoping that the fire won't burn me
Just one time, just one time

All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
[Verse 2: Patrick Stump, 
Taylor Swift & Patrick Stump

I've been left in the rain lost and pining
I'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying
'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart (Woah)
I've gotten used to no one callin' my phone
I've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone
Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right
Just one time
, just one time

All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, 
Patrick Stump

I was thinking just one time (
Just one time
)
Maybe the stars align (
Just one time
)
And maybe I call you mine
And you won't need space
Or string me along while you decide
And just one time (
Just one time
)
Maybe the moment's right (
The moment's right

It's 8:05 and I see two headlights

She says she's no good
With words, but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out a joke of a romantic
Stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too
Overdramatic
Tonight, it's ""it can't get much worse""
Versus ""No one should ever feel like...""

I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half-time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead

You always fold just
Before you're found out
Drink up, it's last call, last resort
But only the first mistake, and I

And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds

You've been saving for his mattress (love)

If they knew how misery loved me

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (Mattress, mattress)
I only want sympathy in the form of you
Crawling into bed with me

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half-time

Oh-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearin' you apart
I'm in the deep details with the Devil
You know, the world can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you out the cage
I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

But my songs know what you did in the dark

So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the dark, dark


Well all the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died
 (Died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
Through a constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love, then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

My songs know what you did in the dark

So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up

Weapons in the form of words
And don't really care which side wins
Long as the room keeps singing, that's just the business I'm in

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress

You're looking pretty sinking
)
But the real bombshells have already sunk
(
Prima donnas of the gutter

At night, we're painting your trash gold while you sleep
Crashing not like hips or cars, no, more like p-p-p-parties

Put on your war paint

You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July
Setting fire to the sky
Here, here comes this rising tide so come on
(Put on your war paint)
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to dies
Silver clouds with grey linings

So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time, we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix


Bring home the boys and scrap,
 
scrap metal the tanks
Get hitched, make a career out of robbing banks
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
""You broke our spirit,"" says the note we pass

So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time, we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel

Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me

Stuck in the jet wash
A bad trip I couldn't get off
Maybe I bit off more than I could chew
Overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the
 
rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black street
And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

I'm not passive but aggressive
Take note, it's not impressive
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse
And it's our time now if you want it to be
Maul the world like the carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic
 and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me
And I still feel that rush in my veins
It twists my head just a bit to think
All those people in those old photographs I've seen are dead


And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

Sometimes I just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes, yeah
And let your dirty sadness fill me up just like a balloon

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend

I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match

You'll never catch us, so just let me be
Said, ""I'll be fine 'til the hospital or American embassy""

Miss Flack said, ""I still want you back""
Yeah, Miss Flack said, ""I still want you back""

I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch
And all I can think of is the way I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you, who gave up on you, oh, woah

They say the captain goes down with the ship
So when the world ends, will God go down with it?

Always know

I said, I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch
And all I can think of is the way I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you, who gave up on you


Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town…


We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it…

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to halftime
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you'd love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me…

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race…

One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
He tastes like you
Only sweeter…

Twice a week I pass by the church that held your funeral
And the pastor's words come pouring down like rain
How he called you a sinner and said now you walk with Jesus
So the drugs that took your life aren't gonna cause you any pain
I don't think he even knew your name
And I refuse to kneel and pray
I won't remember you that way
I lit you a candle in every cathedral across Europe
And I hope you know you're still my patron saint
I tried to forgive, but I can't forget
 
the cigar in his fist
I know that they were heartsick, but I need someone to blame
And I know how they blamed me
I know what you'd say
You'd tell me it was your fault
I should put all my arrows away
I'm sure there ain't a heaven
But that don't mean I don't like to picture you there
I'll bet you're bumming cigarettes off saints
And I'm sure you're still singing
But I'll bet that you're still just a bit out of key
That crooked smile pushing words across your teeth
'Cause you were heat lightning
Yeah, you were a storm that never rolled in
You were the northern lights in a southern town
A caustic fleeting thing
I'll bury your memories in the garden
And watch them grow with the flowers in spring
I'll keep you with me

These wolves in their suits and ties
Saying, ""Kid, you can trust me""
Charming southern drawl, sunken eyes
Buying good will in hotel lobbies
Buy fistfuls of pills to make sure you don't hurt no more
You don't gotta feel anything
Got their fangs in our veins
Got their voice in our head
Got our arms in their grips
No, we can't shake free
This goddamn machine, hungry and heartless
My whole generation got lost in the margin
We put our faith in you and you turned a profit
Now we're drowning here under the waves

Tossed around like sea glass
And you rounded out my edges
I'll feel better when the headaches go away
I've got a scar across my forehead
Turning purple in the cold
From a night at Shore Memorial
I was sixteen and afraid
Turned away
Like I'm working babyface
Out of Mid-South in the eighties
I kept a blade hidden in my wrist tape

I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight 'til my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
I think enough is enough

Hidden in the tall grass
In the naked light of day
Put my past self in the ground
I've been dancing on the grave
I'm not the person that I was then
I'm tearing him away
I was bitter, I was careless
I was nineteen and afraid


But you deserve more from me
I don't know why I would say those things
But you deserve more than me
And I'm trying every day

I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight until my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
I think enough is enough

You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You were the baby teeth I buried
You were the sounds of distant cars
You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You were the banner that says ""no one""
That I tattooed across my heart
You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You scattered like ashes across every song that I write
You’re where the light pollution starts


I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight until my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
Enough is enough",https://genius.com/The-wonder-years-i-dont-like-who-i-was-then-lyrics,"Tossed around like sea glass
And you rounded out my edges
I'll feel better when the headaches go away
I've got a scar across my forehead
Turning purple in the cold
From a night at Shore Memorial
I was sixteen and afraid
Turned away
Like I'm working babyface
Out of Mid-South in the eighties
I kept a blade hidden in my wrist tape
I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight 'til my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
I think enough is enough
Hidden in the tall grass
In the naked light of day
Put my past self in the ground
I've been dancing on the grave
I'm not the person that I was then
I'm tearing him away
I was bitter, I was careless
I was nineteen and afraid
But you deserve more from me
I don't know why I would say those things
But you deserve more than me
And I'm trying every day
I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight until my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
I think enough is enough
You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You were the baby teeth I buried
You were the sounds of distant cars
You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You were the banner that says ""no one""
That I tattooed across my heart
You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark

Cardinal crashed into my window, I think he might die
I'll plan him a funeral, I'll read his last rites
'Cause I know what he saw in that reflection of light
On the glass was a better life

Staring at a hole in your chest
That's been dug there for decades
American broken promises
Caught between the lies you've been fed
And a war with your bloodstream
I should have been there when you needed a friend
I was off on my own again
Selfish and stupid

So if you call me back or let me in
I swear I'll never let you down again
I know the devil you've been fighting with
I swear I'll never let you down again

I had that nightmare again
You're seven and helpless, angry as hell
And you balled up your fists but I laughed at your swings
And I beat you half-conscious
I know that I failed you, woke up in a sweat
I want those years back


So if you call me back or let me in
I swear I'll never let you down again
I know the devil you've been fighting with
I swear I'll never let you down again

We're no saviors if we can't save our brothers
We're no saviors if we can't save our brothers

So if you call me back or let me in
I swear I'll never let you down again
I know the devil you've been fighting with
I swear I'll never let you down again

Moved all my shit into my parent's basement
And out of our old apartment
And I know things changed
But I'm not sure when
I guess you'd call this regression
I left a real job and a girlfriend
Convinced myself that I'm brave enough for all of this, well
I spent a whole year in airports
And the floor feels like home
Oh, at least we're never alone
I lost track of the time zones, I'd call but you know, oh

I'm running on empty
And the late nights and the long drives start to get to me
I'm just so tired

I spent this year as a ghost
And I'm not sure what I'm looking for
A voice on a phone that you rarely answer anymore
I came in here alone, came in here alone
(But that doesn't scare me like it did seven months ago)
I spent this year as a ghost
And I'm not sure where home is anymore


Been on a steady fast food diet
Like we're this generation's
Morgan Spurlock
 
but we don't admit defeat
My body feels rejected
I can't say that I blame it
My heart keeps saying stay young
My lower back seems to disagree
Unrolled a cheap cotton blanket
On an old dirty couch, oh
I felt the year start to wind down
Can't stand any dead space, empty beds bum me out, oh

I spent this year as a ghost
And I'm not sure what I'm looking for
A voice on a phone that you rarely answer anymore
I came in here alone, came in here alone
(But that doesn't scare me like it did seven months ago)
I spent this year as a ghost
And I'm not sure where home is anymore

I came out swinging from a
South Philly basement, caked in stale beer and sweat
Under half-lit fluorescents
 
and I
Spent the winter writing songs about getting better
And if I'm being honest, I'm getting there

Cigarette smoke dances back in the window
And I can see the haze on the dome light
I’m conjuring ghosts on a forty-hour ride home
And they keep asking me what I’m doing with my life
While my cousins go to bed with their wives
I’m feeling like I've fallen behind

Well, the highway won
I’m listening to traffic reports one on one
Coming quietly undone
I was born to run
Away from anything good
An escape artist's son
Sun-drenched pavement in my blood
The first thing that I do when I walk in
Is find a way out for when shit gets bad, and

I’ve been looking for
Tears in the screen door (Tears in the screen door)
I’ve been waiting for
Another disaster (Another disaster)

Well I’m terrified
Like a kid in the sixties
Staring at the sky
Waiting for the bomb to fall
And it’s all a lie
What they say about stability
It scares me sometimes
The emptiness I see in my eyes
And all the kids' names I’ve ever liked
Are tied to tragedy
And I don’t want my children growing up to be
Anything like me


I’ve been looking for
Tears in the screen door (Tears in the screen door)
I’ve been waiting for
Another disaster (Another disaster)
And I was kinda hoping you'd stay
I was kinda hoping you'd stay

I keep a flashlight
And a small knife
In the corner of my bed stand
I keep a flashlight
And the train times
But you wouldn't understand
How could you understand?
Jesus Christ, I’m twenty-six
All the people I graduated with
All have kids
All have wives
All have people who care if they come home at night
Well, Jesus Christ, did I fuck up?

I’ve been looking for

Like a burning monk
You're my light flare out in the dark
You're my constant call to arms
Took the blindfold off
They'd left chalk outlines where the future was
It's a goddamn war of attrition
It's a death by a thousand cuts
And if these motherfuckers made it to heaven
They'd burn the bridge when they got across

They're gathering anchors
They're gathering rope
You're pushed into heaven all alone
They're grabbing your ankles
They won't let you go
The ebb and the distant flow
They're cutting your wings off
Built your ceilings out of stained glass

Well you're caught like gravel in my skinned knee
The wound will close eventually
You'll stay as a reminder of how fucked this world can be
Held your funeral on a Tuesday
Holy water's November-cold
That kid who pulled the trigger
Knew tomorrow couldn't promise him hope


All these bastards are gathering rope
You're pushed into heaven all alone
They're grabbing your ankles
They won't let you go
The ebb and the distant flow
They're cutting your wings off
Built your ceilings out of stained glass
They were cutting your wings off
I was staring at my idle hands
Maybe I could've done something
Maybe I could've made a difference

John Wayne with a God complex
Tells me to buy a gun
Like shooting a teenage kid is gonna solve any problems
Like it's an arms race
Like death don't mean nothing
To know the heavy price of living poor
Walled in by red lines, backed into a corner
Not knowing growing up what it's like to belong here in America
[Bridge 2: Jason Aalon Butler, 
Dan Campbell

If everyone's built the same then how come building's so fucking hard for you?
It's something we're all born into
Nothing's left up to gray
It's black or white and sometimes black and blue
It's something we're all born into, whoa-oh
Now I know what's in a name
Not just my father
Three-fifths a man makes half of me
Why should I bother?
Merchants of Misery stacking the deck
Fuck your John Waynes
Fuck your God complex
I have everything in front of me
But can't reach far enough
To touch those fever dreams
They call American
I am the ghetto's chosen one
The privileged bastard son

God damn, you look holy
Hit from behind with light
You're a painting of a saint
And I'm nervous, stumbling over my lines
When I tell you I love you
And we stare at Catalina
A city lost to the sea
Carried out by the tides
You were the one thing I got right

God damn, you look holy 
bathed in the January light
On the floor of our new bedroom
On the carpet with the window open wide
When you tell me you love me
I can actually see it
Your breath frozen in the air
Newborn droplets of ice
You were the one thing I got right

I'm measuring heartbeats in miles away
You held me together
I used to burst and decay
We got off the airplane
A couple of runaways
I was hoping you'd stay
Could you stay?


You were the obvious one
From a taxi cab in Chelsea
Out past Salvation Mountain
You were the obvious one
From a walk along the highline
Out to Wicker Park in August
You were the obvious one
From your Upper East Side dorm room
To the South West Marin Headlands
With you smiling in the sand
Goddamn, I hate leaving

Another early flight
I ran the dishwasher this morning
I wanted there to be clean plates for you tonight
I've grown used to your perfume
It hangs in the morning light
Wake me up before you leave for work
Kiss me goodbye
You were the one thing I got right

I'm measuring heartbeats in miles away
You held me together
I used to burst and decay
We got off the airplane

The Devil in My Bloodstream Lyrics

We wiped out all the Buffalo
Around the turn of the last century
And so it's factories and sawgrass
Wheat fields and asphalt laid in front of me
The Midwest feels like a hollow place
That we filled with love and industry
And we're staring at the frozen ground in Goodwill suits
Silent as the pastor reads the eulogy
Well I wanted to see just a little bit of everything
Let me be

Two blackbirds on a highway sign
Are laughing at me at four in the morning
They played the war drum out of time
So I'm not sure where I've been marching
I wanna be strong, but it's not easy anymore
I'm hoping I'm wrong

It's sixteen hours straight to home
From the heart of North Missouri
And so I searched through my great-grandpa's memoirs
For the devil in my bloodstream
Depression grabbed his throat
And choked the life out of him slowly
I've got the same blood coursing through my veins
And it'll come for me eventually


I bet I'd be a fucking coward
I bet I'd never have the guts for war
Cause I can't spend another month away from here
These frantic rest stop phone calls don't get answered anymore
But I, I wanted to know if I could please come home
So let me know

Two blackbirds on a highway sign
Are laughing at me at four in the morning
They played the war drum out of time
So I'm not sure where I've been marching
I wanna be strong, but it's not easy anymore
I'm hoping I'm wrong
I'm hoping I'm wrong

I know how it feels to be
At war with a world
That never loved me
I'm hoping I'm wrong

I know how it feels to be
At war with a world
That never loved me

I saw you hiding in the ivy
I know you’re too afraid to call
They’re getting ready for the winter here
They’ve gathered pyramids of salt
You saw them having trouble breathing
I know you think that it’s your fault
I saw you hiding in the ivy
Keeping quiet through the fall

There’s a bird inside your rib cage
He screams so I never forget
I wanna break open your sternum
I wanna rip him from his nest
And sow you back up like a garden
Growing flowers from your chest
There’s a bird inside your rib cage
I keep trying to forget

I drew a line in the sand with these worthless fucking hands
I drew a line in the sand, you washed it away again

I saw you hiding in the ivy
Watched the night start to decay
And you wonder in the morning who’s gonna drag
The sun out of the lake
You move gently off the sore spots
I can see that you're in pain
Everything left in the light here long enough
Is someday gonna fade


I drew a line in the sand with these worthless fucking hands
I drew a line in the sand, you washed it away again
I drew a line in the sand with these goddamn worthless hands
I drew a line in the sand, you washed it away again

We’re so vacant
These bodies
Collapsing
So gracefully
And I love you
And I’m sorry
And I understand if you blame me
And I’m helpless
And you’re drowning
And I’m beating at the water here so desperately
So desperately

I drew a line in the sand with these worthless fucking hands
I drew a line in the sand, you washed it away again
I drew a line in the sand with these goddamn worthless hands

There, There Lyrics
There, There sets the tone for The Greatest Generation. This song is essentially an anthem for socially awkward people and for everyone who feels worthless or lost.

You're just trying to read
But I'm always standing in your light
You're just trying to sleep
But I always wake you up to apologize

I'm sorry I don't laugh at the right times

I know how it seems
When I always sing to myself in public
I babble on like a mad man
I know how it seems
When I'm always staring off into nothing
I'm lost in my head again

I'm sorry I don't laugh at the right times
Is this what it feels like?

I've got my heart strung up on clothing line
Through tenement windows, in mid-July
I've got my heart strung up on clothing line
Through tenement windows


I'm sorry I don't laugh at the right times
Is this what it feels like, with my wings clipped?

Clear the apartment
I plan on collapsing and I could have sworn I heard a car door slam
I'm stuck at the corner of grinding teeth and stomach acid
All alone under a soft rain and streetlamp
I spent my life weighed down by a stone heart
Drowning in irony and settling for anything
Somewhere down the line all the wiring went faulty
I'm scared shitless of failure and I'm staring out at where I wanna be

I just want to sell out my funeral
I just want to be enough for everyone
I just want to sell out my funeral
Know I fought until the lights were gone

I'm walking through harbors and churchyards
I felt the snow crack under my feet
I'll stay thankful for mild winters
, for every shot I got at anything
I'll blame the way that I was brought up or the flaws that I was born with
Or the mistakes that I've made
They're all just fucking excuses
So bury me in the memories of my friends and family
I just need to know that they were proud of me


I just want to sell out my funeral
I just want to be enough for everyone
I just want to sell out my funeral
Know I fought until the lights were gone

And oh, we all wanna know
Where'd the American Dream go?
Did you give up and go home?
Am I here alone?
And oh, when the credits roll
I'll watch as the screen glows
The moments when I choked, all the fears that I've outgrown
At least I hope so

The sky goes from concrete to charcoal
I'm laying on my back on the roof
Gonna shoot these clouds full of holes
I need some fucking light to pour through
'Cause December's got me up against the ropes
And I don't know how to get loose
I can't get feeling back in my toes
From walking in circles with you
Like we're lost Canadian geese
I should be south of here already

I'll be your dead bird, you'll be my bloodhound
You're just doing what you're told
Pick my body off the ground
I'll be your dead bird...

I'm staring at Hemingway's shotgun
And I'll picture him drinking alone
He's forgetting things that he wouldn't have before
His eyes are starting to go
And I heard all about how his plane went down
After Christmas in the Congo
Read about his own death in the paper
I bet it was freeing to know
When you destroy everything worth chasing
There's nowhere left to go


I'll be your dead bird, you'll be my bloodhound
You're just doing what you're told
Pick my body off the ground
I'll be your dead bird
Hanging from your mouth
You're doing like you're told
Gonna make your master proud
It's good to know
I didn't die for nothing

December’s got me backed into a corner again
My ears are back, my teeth are showing
I'm combing through the wreckage trying to find where I've been
I still get phantom pains, but from a safer distance

I'll be your dead bird, you'll be my bloodhound
You're just doing what you're told
Pick my body off the ground
I'll be your dead bird
Hanging from your mouth
You're doing like you're told
Gonna make your master proud

Raining in Kyoto
It's flooding the streets
I'm nursing a coffee from a vending machine
I saw the god of rice, a fox with a key
I woke up blind with a headache
Grinding my teeth
Confused and alone and taking pills to sleep
They soften your absence but they don't let me dream

Raining in Kyoto
My breath turns into steam
I buy you a candle, not even sure what it means
I cursed at the matches
And drown in my grief, grief
An old man stood close by, smiled at me
I rung the bell like he did
I told you I'm sorry
A makeshift funeral, I tried setting you free

You're half asleep
And I bought you a radio to drown out the machines
Hospital light, you asked about the weather, wish that they'd let you outside


Raining in Kyoto
I'm starting to shake
They'll hold your service tomorrow
I'm an ocean away
Reach into my pocket, found a small paper crane
It's been over a year now
April turns into May
I've barely stopped moving, I've been so fucking afraid
Too much of a coward to even visit your grave

You're half awake
And I bought you a radio to play the blues away
With my hand to hold, you asked about the weather, wish they'd let you die at home

You're half awake
And I bought you a radio to play the blues away
Hospital light, you asked about the weather, wish that they'd let you outside

I woke up blind with a headache
Grinding my teeth
Confused and alone and taking pills to sleep
Raining in Kyoto
My breath turns into steam
I buy you a candle, not even sure what it means
I cursed at the matches
And drown in my grief, grief
I rung the bell like he did
I told you I'm sorry
A makeshift funeral, I tried setting you free
You're half asleep
Raining in Kyoto
I'm starting to shake
They'll hold your service tomorrow
I'm an ocean away
It's been over a year now
April turns into May
I've barely stopped moving, I've been so fucking afraid
You're half awake
You're half awake
Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodbye","Raining in Kyoto It's flooding the streets I'm nursing a coffee from a vending machine I saw the god of rice, a fox with a key I woke up blind with a headache Grinding my teeth Confused and alone and taking pills to sleep Raining in Kyoto My breath turns into steam I buy you a candle, not even sure what it means I cursed at the matches And drown in my grief, grief I rung the bell like he did I told you I'm sorry A makeshift funeral, I tried setting you free You're half asleep Raining in Kyoto I'm starting to shake They'll hold your service tomorrow I'm an ocean away It's been over a year now April turns into May I've barely stopped moving, I've been so fucking afraid You're half awake You're half awake Goodnight Goodnight Goodbye"

The moon is hanging low, over the central station
I watch the buses leave in silence
Bound for foreign, distant places
The Andes hold me close
A mother's only son
I feel weightless in the valley
Like I'm everywhere at once

I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
We’re sister cities
I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
We’re sister cities

We came here, abandoned
An old brick-faced apartment
Rusted swing set in the courtyard
Like the one that I was born in
I'm guarded like I'm wounded
My first instinct's always “run”
I wanna turn to steam
I wanna call it off
I wanna lighten the dark
I wanna swallow the sun


I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
We’re sister cities
I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home...

I was just mange, and skin, and bone
You took me into your home
Kept warm on a blanket from your
Worn out winter coat

I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
We’re sister cities

Bright blue hydrangeas
Lost in the weeds
Bus stops and barbed wire on the way
 
to stare
At the heart of the earth from the Poas peak
Just like the ones that we grew back in Jersey
Hung upside down, drying out for the wedding

There's a man with his head in his hands on the sidewalk
His wife's there behind him just off of the street
She scratches his back as he sobs on the asphalt
And what strikes me most is the symmetry
How they're framed just like you and me
When the light from the hospital's eastern wing
Tangles up in your hair and the sadness that pooled in my heart
Starts emptying slowly

Well I saw you last night in my dream
And there were hydrangeas where your face should be

The redwoods feel lonely and lunar and distant
The sun comes in fragments through breaks in the trees
And I feel further from home than I've ever been
These thin lines of light across space tether you to me
They pull in my memories, back to our apartment on 2nd Street
Through the South-facing window the light catches lengths of your hair
Like a path that you left me


Well I saw you last night in my dream
But there were azaleas where your face should be

Pieces of us in the morning sun
Sleeping bags under the 101
She takes off his glasses as he falls asleep again
They don't got much but goddamn they got love

Well I saw you last night in my dream
I'm gonna marry you underneath driftwood from Crescent City",https://genius.com/The-wonder-years-flowers-where-your-face-should-be-lyrics,"Bright blue hydrangeas

I'll never be the same, break in decency
Don't be tree trunk, don't fall on my living roots
I've been humming too many words, got a weak self-esteem
That's been stomped away from every single dream
But it's something else that brought us fees
Keep it all inside 'til we feel we can't unleash
But I think that you made it up, I think that your mind is gone
I think you shouldn't have glorified, now you're wrong

Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
They fuck with my head
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck it, pig

You and me out here alone
Face flat along the edge of the glass
Well, 
I'm not here to preach
, I'm just sick of that
My parents made me strong to look up that glass
So why should I try? Act like I'm a little pissed off
With all that shit that needs to stay back in the shelf
Your punk ass made it up, now your fuckin' mind is gone
Should've never glorified, now you're right


Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
They fuck with my head
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, bitch

Shut up, you don't know me
Shut up, you don't know me
Squeal like a pig when you
Pickpocket, big fuckin' head

Well, I'll tell you about my blunt stack
What's coming back, 
Jack
? We'll turn back
Curse, fighting their words, tell them that you fucking heard
I mean, they know that's what's coming, nigga
,
 you quitter
I'm thinking 'bout something naughty and won't tell anybody
So, thinking of me by now, but you go grab it
I'd like to think, for who I down this shit
I belong where they be, 
'cause we cannot get back those lives

Resist to cease, understand?
God hates black shades and all the clergy
Mr. P.I.G.
 Could I fucking see?
Shorty done crushed all of my brothers' dignity
And to the jury, carry your turns
On my skin this color
, does that mean I'm burnt?
'Cause your punk ass made it up, your fuckin' mind was gone
Should've never glorified, wrong

Rosemary Lyrics

There's no sound
But the engine's drone
Our minds set free
To roam

Time (Shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes

Our minds bend
And our fingers fold
Entwined, we dream
Unknown

Time (Shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes

Stay with me
As we cross the empty skies
Come sail with me


We slow down
As the engines stall
Our eyes catch sync
Explode

Time (Shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes
Time (Shift)
As we collide with the energy
In other ways

Stay with me
As we cross the empty skies
Come sail with me
We play in dreams
As we cross through space and time
Just stay with me

I like you when
When you take off your face
You put away all your teeth
 and take us way underneath

It drives me crazy, just drives me wild

I kinda like you when

Conversion, software version 7.0
Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub

Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

New, what do you own, the world?
How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence
Sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

More wood for their fires, loud neighbors
Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck

Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river and one again after the fall
Swimming through the void, we hear the word
We lose ourselves, but we find it all

And we are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play, but you never wanna lose

Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life

Life is a waterfall
We drink from the river, then we turn around and put up our walls
Swimming through the void, we hear the word

ATWA Lyrics
“ATWA” stands for “Air, Trees, Water, and Animals.” Which was an ecologist mandate begun by the notorious Charles Manson, whom Malakian has cited several times as an inspiration.

To visible police, presence-sponsored fear
Battalions of riot police with rubber bullet kisses
Baton courtesy,

Beyond the Staples Center you can see America
With its tired poor avenging disgrace
Peaceful, loving youth against the brutality
Of plastic existence

Pushing little children with their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around

They like to push the weak around

A rush of words, pleading to disperse
Upon your naked walls, alive

With a helmet, fierce
Trained and appropriate for the malcontents
For the disproportioned malcontents

Soldier Side Lyrics
A song decrying war. Daron said he could strongly relate to mothers whose sons were going out to fight. Based on that emotion, he wrote the song.

Dead man lying on the bottom of the grave
Wondering when savior comes, is he gonna be saved?
Maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life
Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die

They were crying when their sons left, God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope, he's never coming back
They were crying when their sons left, all young men must go
He's come so far to find the truth, he's never going home

Young men standing on the top of their own graves
Wondering when Jesus comes, are they gonna be saved?
Cruelty to the winner, bishop tells the king his lies
Maybe you're a mourner, maybe you deserve to die

They were crying when their sons left, God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope, he's never coming back
They were crying when their sons left, all young men must go
He's come so far to find the truth, he's never going home



Welcome to the soldier side, where there's no one here but me
People all grow up to die, there is no one here but me
Welcome to the soldier side, there is no one here but me
People on the soldier side, there is no one here but me

Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone, I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh, my smile was taken long ago
If I can change, I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (Without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

So save your breath, I will not care
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh, my love was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go


Oh, oh

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh, my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know",https://genius.com/Slipknot-snuff-lyrics,"Türkçe

Ooh, yeah

I did my time, and I want out
So effusive, fade, it doesn't cut, the soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion,
 pseudo-sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done, it has begun, I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
We throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the temple fell, the secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had
Who needs another mess? We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness, venomous, insipid
I think we're done, I'm not the only one

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
If the pain goes on, ah

I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my time's elapsed
Now all I do is live with so much fate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact
You cannot kill what you did not create
I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it


Put me back together or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone
Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside

Here comes the pain

Enemy, show me what you wanna be
I can handle anything, even if I can't handle you
Readily, either way, it better be
Don't you fuckin' pity me

What the hell am I sayin'?
I don't know about malevolent
Sure as hell decadent
I want somebody to step up, step off
Walls, let me fall, fuck you all
Get a grip, 
don't let me slip 'til I drop the ball

Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it
You're goin' down, this is a war
Fuck it

Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind?
You're leavin' me suspect, I'm leavin' you grotesque
Feels like a burn from which you never learn
Cause and effect, you jealous ass
Press your face against the glass, suffer


Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it
You're goin' down, this is a war
Go

I've just begun
It's about that time, gotta get mine

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(
I'll never kill myself to save my soul
)
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(
I didn't come this far to sink so low
)
I'm finally holding on to letting go

I'm just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a lord and you pray to it
You're so demanding when you want the truth
But your stories don't read for me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go


Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God
But did you think you'd shake your own?
This killing field is all grown over
The motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The anti-antagonist is back in style
(
Myopic
) Cannot see straight
(
Dystopic

You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your bibles don't work on me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting
Go

Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me
You've killed the saint in me


Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

Goodbye
I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time
Everything is 3D blasphemy
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up
This is not the way I pictured me
I can't control my shakes,
 
how the hell did I get here?
Something about this, so very wrong
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this
Is it a dream or a memory?

Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed


Get outta my head, 'cause I don't need this
Why didn't I see this?
But I'm a victim, Manchurian candidate
I have sinned by just
Makin' my mind up and takin' your breath away

Undo these chains, my friend
I'll show you the rage I've hidden
Perish the sacrament
Swallow, but nothing's forgiven

You and I can't decide
Which of us was taken for granted
Make amends
Some of us are destined to be outlived

Step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore

Under the words of men
Something is tempting the father
Where is your will, my friend?
Insatiates never even bother


You and I, wrong or right
Traded a lie for the leverage
In between the lens in light
You're not what you seem

Step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil

Your station is abandoned
Fooled you 'cause I know what you've done

You should've burned when you turned on everyone

Yeah

Insane, am I the only motherfucker with a brain?
I'm hearing voices, but all they do is complain
How many times have you wanted to kill
Everything and everyone? Say you'll do it but never will

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

'Cause he's a phantom, a mystery, and that leaves me nothing

Everywhere I go, there's a sense of it

Caring never felt so lame inside
Anybody else got pride? Do you wanna take my life?
Maybe I'll reverse my ride

Better get away from me
Stay the fuck away from me

You live when I'm dead

Everybody hates me now, so fuck it
Blood's on my face and my hands
And I don't know why

What's the matter with calamity anyway?
Right? Get the fuck outta my face
Understand that I can't feel anything
I feel like a wound like I got a fuckin' gun against my head
You live when I'm dead
One more time, motherfucker
Everybody hates me now, so fuck it
Blood's on my face and my hands
And I don't know why
I'm not afraid to cry
But that's none of your business
I wanna leave without a trace
'Cause I don't wanna die in this place

Watch this

I'm never enough
You bleed me dry, using me up
Dissatisfied and used
Another key to the empty spot in you
I'm sick as a fuck
I'm in my prime, what do you want?
I guess it's time to see
If you're lost in hell, you'll find no peace

Ooh, wade through hate and fear
I haven't felt like this in years
Not much left, so uprooted
Fists clenched tight in the pockets of my hoodie
And I know where I need to go
But the voice of reason can't say no
It's in the eyes and heart
Just the latest psycho off the charts

That's what you do best


A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity, nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me, at the end of the day that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity, nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me, at the end of the day that's what you do best

I know, and even if I didn't, I would lie so
Many would believe it
Stand up and resist the chains
Of all the people in belligerent sick restraint
I wasn't enough
You bled me dry, which way is up?
Oh, you're a lie and a fake
I hope the truth is not too late

That's what you do best

A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity, nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me, at the end of the day that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity, nobody does it better than the enemy

Since you never gave a damn in the first place
Maybe it's time you had the tables turned
'Cause in the interest of all involved, I got the problem solved
And the verdict is guilty

Man, nearly killed me
, 
steppin' where you fear to tread
Stop, drop and roll, you were dead from the get-go
Big mouth fucker, stupid cocksucker
Are you scared of me now? Then you're dumber than I thought
Always is and never was
Foundation made of piss and vinegar
Step to me, I'll smear ya, think I fear ya? Bullshit
Just another dumb punk chompin' at this tit
Is there any way to break through the noise?
Was it something that I said that got you bent?
It's gotta be that way if you want it
Sanity, literal profanity, hit me

Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out


Maybe it's the way you gotta spread a lot of rumor, fodder
Keepin' all your little spies and leavin' when you realize
Step up, fairy
I guess it's time to bury your ass with the chrome
Straight to the dome
You heard me right, bitch, I didn't stutter
And if you know what's good just shut up and beg, brother
Backstab, don't you know who you're dissin'?
Sideswipe, we know the ass that you're kissin'

Bigity-biggidy bitch-boy, halfway hauser
Don't hear shit 'cause it keeps gettin' louder
Come up and you get a face full of tactic
Lippin' off hard, goin' home in a basket
You got no pull, no power, no nothin'
Now you start shit? Well, ain't that somethin'?
Payoffs don't protect, and you can hide if you want
But I'll find you, comin' up behind you

Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out


'Bout time I set this record straight
All the needle-nose punchin' is makin' me irate
Sick of my bitchin' fallin' on deaf ears
Where you gonna be in the next five years?
The crew and all the fools and all the politics
Get your lips ready, gonna gag, gonna make you sick
You got dick when they passed out the good stuff
Bam, are you sick of me? Good enough, had enough
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemas

Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is 
stamp
 you out

Before I Forget Lyrics
The 4th single to be released from Slipknot’s 3rd album, “Before I Forget” won the 2006 Grammy for Best Metal Performance.



As with all the songs on Vol. 3… it is profanity-free.

Go

Stapled shut, inside an outside world, and I'm
Sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home
I'm claustrophobic, closing in
And I'm catastrophic, not again
I'm smeared across the page and doused in gasoline
I wear you like a stain, yet I'm the one who's obscene
Catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections
I've got no time to lose, I'm just caught up in all the cattle

Fray the strings
Throw the shapes
Hold your breath
Listen

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that


I'm ripped across the ditch
And settled in the dirt and I
Wear you like a stitch
Yet I'm the one who's hurt
Pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions
I've got no right to win, I'm just caught up in all the battles

Locked in clutch
Pushed in place
Hold your breath
Listen

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that

My end, it justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
My every attempt to evade
The end of the road
And my end, it justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
My every attempt to evade
The end of the road


I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget

She seemed dressed in all of me
Stretched across my shame
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me
I'd do anything to have her to myself

I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

She is everything to me
The unrequited dream
A song that no one sings
The unattainable
She's a myth that I have to believe in

I have this one
De-da-dat, de-da-dat, de-da-dat-dat-dat
De-da-dat, de-da-dat, de-da-dat-dat-dat
Yeah
Yeah
Rise

Half-alive and stark-raving free and maligned
For encroaching on the purpose of this commercial-free interruption
Due to the prolific nature of this statement
Listener aggression is advised

It's strange, whenever I see a gun
I think about just how petty you are
And it blows my fucking mind
Yeah, it blows my fucking mind
These days, I never seem to get enough
I'm tired of this shit, I wanna go home
Don't waste my fucking time
Don't waste my fucking time
Because anything exceptional
Gets crushed by common people
With jealousy and ignorance
And all their common evils
This planet isn't special
Collections made of clay
I'm waiting for the punishment
I know it's on my way


So cut, cut, cut me up
And fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up
And fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up
And fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up
And fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up
And fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up
And fuck, fuck, fuck me up

Irreverence is my disease
It's secondhand, but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity

Somewhere on a toilet wall, I read the words
""You form a line to formalize the former lies""
And I finally saw the truth
Something so profound, and it was sitting there
Surrounded by the garbage and the stains
Another victim of the refuse
Now I've been saying this for years
But you don't comprehend it
I fight hell and I fight fear
Because I understand it
Androgyny and insults
You try so hard to be difficult
You wanna win the war?
Know what you're fighting for


Cut, cut, cut me up
And fuck, fuck, fuck me up

The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity
With angel eyes and demon seeds
You're missing what you really need
When all is said and done, you see
The last man standing gets no pity

(No pity)

Today, up on this hill, I'm counting all the killers
They sway as they swarm, a look of gluttons in their eyes
They mutter as the body loses warmth
They pick your bones like locks inside a tomb
And take great care to not take care of you
Here’s an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one

While I was learning to live, we all were living a lie
I guess you got what you wanted
So I will settle for a slaughterhouse soaked in blood and betrayal
It's always somebody else, somebody else was me
You want the real smile?
Or the one I used to practice not to feel like a failure?

I don’t need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me

Here’s an unexplainable one
Here’s an unexplainable one

I'm not ahead of my time, I just drew the first breath
If I’m alive tomorrow
I will alleviate the pressure by cutting you out of me
I found my bottom line dead on the front lines
I know I'll never go home
So set fire to your ships and past regrets and be free

I don't need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don’t need you to hide it from me
I just wanna feel like any other man
I won't show you my whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away, here's an unexplainable one

What have you done?
What have you done?
Yeah


Oh, while I was learning to live, you taught me how to die
I guess I got what I wanted

Something takes a part of me

Part I: Daddy
]

Mother, please forgive me
I just had to get out all my pain and suffering
Now that I am done, remember I will always love you
I'm your son

Little child, looking so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
Innocent child, looking so sweet
I'll rape your mind and now your flesh I reap

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, ""That's a good boy""
And fucked your own child
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, saw you watch
Mommy, why your own child?

Little child, looking so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy


You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, ""That's a good boy""
And fucked your own child
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, saw you watch
Mommy, why?

It's alright

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, ""That's a good boy""
And fuck, your own child
I weep, no one hears me
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, no one hit me
And raped your own child
I'm sick, no one hears me
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, ""That's a good boy""
You fucked your own child
I speak, no one hears me
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, no one hears me
Mommy, why your own child?


I didn't touch you there
Mommy said she didn't care
I didn't touch you there
That's why Mommy stopped and stared

Little child, looking so sweet
I rape your mind, and on your flesh I reap

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, ""That's a good boy""
And fuck your own child
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, saw you watch
Mommy, why your own child?
You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, saw you watch
Daddy, why your own child?
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar

I fuckin' hate you
Oh, you fucker
Motherfucker, I fuckin' hate you, fuck you
You son of a bitch
You fuckin' ruined my life
I wanted to die
I'm sick of it, motherfucker
You fuckin' bitch
I hate you
I fuckin' hate you
I hate you
You piece of shit
Why?
I hate you

When I awake, I'll see Thy face
When I awake, I will see Thy light
Mother, awake me from my dreams
Mother, awake me in Thy light
Hand in hand, we are dancing together
Dancing together in Thy Light

Part II: Michael & Geri
]

Hi, Geri
Uh, is it okay if I come over and take a look at your exhaust manifold on your Dodge Dart?
I've got a piece missing somewhere on mine, and I'm not sure what it is
I wanna see what you got on yours, ha-ha
Throttle lever strikes dashpot rod; the rod must push diaphragm back
Before it can move back, air must be pushed up in
This causes the diaphragm to move slowly when the throttle valve is moved away
Stream will force diaphragm out, the air must now vent, dashpot is ready to work again
(Mhm, see this?)
I don't care what that-
(The rod that they're talking about—)
I don't care what that looks like, Geri, I'm telling you what the dash-pot is
Where's the dash-pot on here, Geri?
(I don't know)
Dashpot is inside. Geri, where it's hooked up at
And that is not made— that is not made to regulate the fuckin' choke goin' back and forth
(And that's not the end-loader?)
That's so you can get pure fuel in there
As soon as you start cranking it over, whoa
It will start sucking, and when I start sucking, this choke here-
'Cause you can't just have pure fuel, it won't light, you have to have a little bit of oxygen
It sucks open and it cracks the choke like this
And that's how that works
(That is not what you just said)
I said no, Geri, the heating is the motherfucking spring
This one here, as soon as you start turnin' over the engine
It's supposed to pull it back when the vacuum starts
When the vacuum starts, nothin' to do with fuckin' heat, vacuum
(Why are you screaming?)
Because you said— you said ""It's supposed to work off heat,"" no, Geri
(You said, ""As the car gradually warms up..."")
As it gradually warms up, this motherfucker with the coil, the spring, opens it up
This has already done its job; the only thing it's job is to do is when you're cranking the engine up
After it's been choked, all it does is pull back, and it cracks it open just a pinch
(Then you don't know what it's called)
The Choke Vacuum Diaphragm (Okay)
I mean, it's right there in the book
(Sure it is)
Oh, God, you're a hard, hard woman to live with
(If it was right here in the book, I would have found it)
Oh, you motherfucker, you asshole, you stupid son of a bitch, you showed it to me
(What?)
You showed me the goddamn thing in the book, what it was called, that's what I knew what it was
(Get out of here and quit yelling at me)
No, Geri, you're fucked
(I haven't seen that in there)
""I haven't seen it,"" you stupid son of a bitch
(That vacuum thing? Yes)
(We don't know what the little business is.)
(It doesn't explain anything, I haven't read anything that explains that)
I told you what it says (yeah, you did, yes, yesterday)
I just told you what it did
And you're sittin' there saying you never saw that before
And yet you're the one that fuckin' showed me it, Geri
(You stink like gas)
(I told you that fuckin' fuel filter was not on there)
(It's not that fuckin' orange business hanging across the goddamn business)
Let's try rebuilding the fucking carburetor first, Geri
Let me tell you something, Geri
Let me tell you a little secret, Geri
(Don't tell me any secrets, be quiet)
Oh, man, I quit, I am fed up, I mean
I tell you something and you fuckin' don't believe me
You show me something and you still don't fuckin' believe me
(I can't show you anything, Michael, because your head is blank)
Well, you're sitting there telling me that motherfucker isn't that
Well, that's not how it works
Well, Geri, a mechanic told me that's how it works

Part I: Daddy
]
Mother, please forgive me
I just had to get out all my pain and suffering
I'm your son
Little child, looking so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
Innocent child, looking so sweet
I'll rape your mind and now your flesh I reap
You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, ""That's a good boy""
And fucked your own child
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, saw you watch
Mommy, why your own child?
Little child, looking so pretty

It hurt, I'm not a liar

Mommy, why?
It's alright
You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, ""That's a good boy""
And fuck, your own child
I weep, no one hears me
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, no one hit me
And raped your own child
I'm sick, no one hears me
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, ""That's a good boy""
You fucked your own child
I speak, no one hears me
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, no one hears me
Mommy, why your own child?
I didn't touch you there
Mommy said she didn't care
I didn't touch you there
That's why Mommy stopped and stared
Little child, looking so sweet
You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, ""That's a good boy""
And fuck your own child
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar

You son of a bitch
You fuckin' ruined my life
I wanted to die
I'm sick of it, motherfucker
You fuckin' bitch
I hate you
I fuckin' hate you
I hate you

Why?

When I awake, I will see Thy light

I wanna see what you got on yours, ha-ha

I don't care what that-

I don't care what that looks like, Geri, I'm telling you what the dash-pot is
Where's the dash-pot on here, Geri?
(I don't know)
(And that's not the end-loader?)
That's so you can get pure fuel in there
And that's how that works

It's supposed to pull it back when the vacuum starts

Are you ready?

There's a place inside my mind
A place I like to hide
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances

I'm so blind
Blind, blind

Another place I'll find
To escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances

I'm so blind
Blind, blind


Deeper and deeper and deeper
As I dream to live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That can never find a way to reach my inner
Self-esteem is low,
 how deep can I go
In the ground that I lay, if I don't find a way to
See through the gray that clouds my mind?
This time I look to see what's between the lines

I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind

[Intro: Fred Durst & 
Jonathan Davis

Say what, say what?
Say what, say what?
Say what, say what?
I say what, say what?
My dick is bigger than yours
Ooh, I say what, say what?
I say what, say what?
I say what, say what?
My band is bigger than yours

Too bad, I got your beans in my bag
You stuck-up sucker, Korny motherfucker
Taking over flows is the Limp pimp
Need a Bizkit to save this crew from Jon Davis
I'm gonna drop a little east side skill
Ya best step back 'cause I'ma kill, I'ma kill
So, what you thinking, Mr. raggedy man?
Doing all you can to look like Raggedy Ann

Check you out, punk, yes, I know you feel it
You look like one of those dancers from the Hanson video
You little faggot ho
Please give me some shit to work with
'Cause right now I'm all it, kid
Suck my dick, kid, like your daddy did

[Verse 3: Fred Durst & 
Jonathan Davis
]
Who the 
fuck you think you're talking to
? 
(
Me
)
I'm known for eating little whiny chumps like you 
(
Whatever
)
All up in my face with that ""are you ready?""
But halitosis is all you're rocking steady
You little fairy
, 
smelling on your flowers
Nappy hairy chest, look, it's Austin Powers (
Aw, yeah, baby
)
I hear ya tweetin' on them fag-pipes
, clod
But you said it best, there's no place to hide
[Verse 4: Jonathan Davis & 
Fred Durst
]
What the fuck ya saying? You're a pimp, whatever, 
Limp dick
Fred Durst needs to rehearse, needs to reverse what he's saying
Wanna be 
Funkdoobiest
 when you're playing
Ripping up a bad 
counterfeit
, faking
Plus your bills, I'm paying
You can't eat that shit every day, Fred
Lay off the bacon
Say what, say what?
You better watch your fucking mouth, Jon
[Chorus: Jonathan Davis & 
Fred Durst
]
So, you hate me
And I hate you
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family (
Yeah
)
I hate you
And you hate me
You know what?
It's all in the family


Look at you, fool, I'm gonna fuck you up twice
Throwing rhymes at me like, oh shit, alright, Vanilla Ice
Ya better run, run while ya can (Say what?)
Can never fuck me up, 
Bisc Limpkit
 (Say what?)
At least I got a P.H.A.T. original band
[Verse 6: Fred Durst & 
Jonathan Davis
]
Who's hot, who's not?
 (
You
)
You best step back, 
Korn on the cob
 (
Okay
)
You need a new job
 (
Ha
)
Time to take them mic skills
Back to the dentist and buy yourself a new grill
 (
Fuck you
)
You pumpkin pie
, 
I'll jack off in your eye
Climbing shoots and ladders
, while your ego shatters
But you just can't get away

Get a-

Waiting for your little peanut
[Verse 9: Fred Durst & 
Jonathan Davis
]
Wait, where'd you get that little dance? (
Over here
)
Like them idiots in Waco, you're burning up in Bako
Where your father had your mother
Your mother had your brother (
Nuh-uh
)
It's just too bad your father's mad, your mother's now your lover

Come on, hillbilly
Can your horse do a fucking wheelie?
You love it down south and, boy
You sure do got a purdy mouth
[Chorus: Jonathan Davis & 
Fred Durst
]
I hate you
And you hate me
You know what, you know what? (
Yeah

Hey, I'm feeling tired
My time has gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes that's okay
Do what others say
I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

Day is here fading
That's when I'm insane
I flirt with suicide
Sometimes kill the pain
I can't always say
""It's gonna be better tomorrow""
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

Beating me down
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
Screaming so sound
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground


(Falling away from me)
It's spinning round and round
(Falling away from me)
It's lost and can't be found
(Falling away from me)
It's spinning round and round
(Falling away from me)
Throw it down

Beating me down
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
Screaming so sound
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground

Twisting me, they won't go away
So I pray, go away

Life's falling away from me
It's falling away from me
Life's falling away from me
Fuck


Beating me down
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
Screaming so sound
Beating me, beating me
Down, down

Here I am different in this normal world
Why'd you tease me, made me feel upset?
Fucking stereotypes feeding their heads
I am ugly, please just go away

This blessing in disguise

Made the hate stay

As I walk I can never seem to escape
All the laughing, all the pain

You wouldn't know a real man if you saw it
It keeps going on day after day, son
Hey you, faget, get away, we don't want none
I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way every day
Who gives a fuck? Right now I got something to say
To all the people that think that I'm strange
And I should be out here locked up in a cage
You don't know what the hell is up now anyway
You got this pretty boy feeling like I'm enslaved
To a world that never appreciated shit
You can suck my dick and fucking like it



I'm just a pretty boy, I'm not supposed to fuck a girl
I'm just a pretty boy living in this fucked up world

Hate, something, sometime, someway
Something kicked off the front for me
Something inside (I'll never ever follow)
So give me something that is for real (I'll never ever follow)

Get your boogie on
Get your boogie on

Hate
, something, someway, each day
Feeling ripped off and given away
This shit inside
 (Now everyone will follow)
So give me nothing, just feel (And now this shit will follow)

God paged me, ""You'll never see the light"", who wants to see?
God told me, ""I've already got the life"", oh I say
God paged me, ""You'll never see the light"", who wants to see?
God told me, ""I've already got the life"", oh I say

Each day I can feel it swallow
Inside something took from me
I don't feel your deathly ways
Each day I feel so hollow
Inside I was beating me
You will never see, so come dance with me
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
Dance with me (Rum-biddie-boo, rum-bum-dee-dum)
Dance with me

Coming Undone Lyrics

Keep holding on when my brain's ticking like a bomb
Guess the black thoughts have come again to get me
Sweet bitter words unlike nothing I have heard
Sing along mockingbird, you don't affect me

That's right, deliver it to my heart
Please strike, be deliberate (Deliberate)

Wait, I'm coming undone
Irate, I'm coming undone
Too late, I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate
And soon, I anticipate
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate

Choke, choke again,
 
I thought my demons were my friends
Pity me in the end, they're out to get me
Since I was young, I've tasted sorrow on my tongue
And the sweet sugar gun does not protect me


That's right, trigger between my eyes
Please strike, make it quick now (Now)

Wait, I'm coming undone
Irate, I'm coming undone
Too late, I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate
And soon, I anticipate
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate

I'm trying to hold it together
Head is lighter than a feather
Looks like I'm not getting better
Not getting better

Wait, I'm coming undone

Hey you, hey you, Devil's little sister
Listening to your twisted transistor
Hold it between your legs

But don't give up because the music do

And then it's reaching inside you
Forever preaching, ""Fuck you too""
Your scream's a whisper
Hang on you, twisted transistor

Hey you, hey you, finally you get it
The world ain't fair, eat you if you let it
And as your tears fall on
Your breasts, your dress
Vibrations coming through
You're in a mess

But don't give up because the music do
Music do, music do

""Anger builds within my body"", alright, go
(Ah) ""Four"" I just said, (Four?) you 
faggot
 piece of shit (Four?) on the ground
Four?
Ugh, hey, what are you talkin' about, Ross?
Hey, the song starts
Hey, are you saying so there's no clicks?

Hey, we're recording, now 
start

Just fucking do it, dammit
Look at ""Twist"", I wish we could put ""Twist"" on the fuckin' tape
Wanna hear it? (Stupid)
Fuck you, fuck you

Go

Okay, you piece of shit

Anger inside builds within my body
Why'd you hit me?
What have I done?
You tried to hit me

Scream at me again if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me
What's with you, boy? Think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared to be honest, be yourself
A cowardly man


I don't run around
Trying to be what's not within me
Look into my eyes, I am free
You're just a wannabe

Scream at me again if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me
What's with you, boy? Think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared to be honest, be yourself
A cowardly man

To come out

Hit me, clown, because I'm not from your town now
Hit me, clown
Hit me, clown, because I'm not from your town now
Hit me, clown
Hit me, clown, because I'm not from your town now
Hit me, clown

Rotting in Vain Lyrics
The first single from Korn’s new album, The Serenity of Suffering. Premiered in Chicago on July 16, 2016:

I wouldn't be angry if you'd just fucking cry
Your tears would arouse me, refreshing my supply
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in vain

I wouldn't be angry if things would stay the same
You're fighting the torment that helps me feed my pain
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in...

I can't hear this 
(scat singing)
I can't fuck it 
(scat singing)
I can't take this 
(scat singing)
I hate... 
(scat singing)


Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in...

Trash Lyrics

How did it start?
Well, I don't know, I just feel the craving
I see the flesh, and it smells fresh
And it's just there for the taking
These little girls
They make me feel so goddamn exhilarated
I fill them up, I can't give it up
The pain that I'm just erasing

I tell my lies, and I despise every second I'm with you
So I run away, and you still stay, so what the fuck is with you?

Your feelings, I can't help but rape them!
I'm sorry, I don't feel the same!
My heart inside is constantly hating!
I'm sorry, I just throw you away!

I don't know why I'm so fucking cold
I don't know why it hurts me
All I wanna do is get with you
And make the pain go away
Why do I have a conscience?
All it does is fuck with me
Why do I have this torment?
All I wanna do is fuck it away


I tell my lies, and I despise every second I'm with you
So I run away, and you still stay, so what the fuck is with you?

Your feelings, I can't help but rape them!
And I'm sorry, I don't feel the same!
My heart inside is constantly hating!
I'm sorry, I just throw you away!

I tell my lies, and I despise every second I'm with you!
And I run away and you still stay, so what the fuck is with you?!

Your feelings, I can't help but rape them!

Ring around the rosies, pocket full of posies
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down
Ring around the rosies, pocket full of posies

Into my childhood, they're spoon-fed
Hidden violence revealed darkness that seems real
Look at the pages that cause all this evil

One, two, buckle my shoe, three, four, shut the door
Five, six, pick up sticks, seven, eight, lay them straight
London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down
London Bridge is falling down, my fair lady

What doesn't kill you makes you wish you were dead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper, and I can't take
One more moment of this silence, the loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up

It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I'm not okay and it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?

Who will fix me now? Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
Who will make me fight? Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown

What doesn't destroy you, leaves you broken instead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper, and I can't take
One more moment of this silence,
 
the loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up

It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I'm not okay and it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?


Who will fix me now? Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
Who will make me fight? Drag me out alive?

I'm a believer in nobody
Won't let me leave 'cause I've seen something
Hope I don't sneeze, I don't *sneeze*
Really we just need to fear something
Only pretending to feel something
I know you're dying to run
I wanna turn you around

Please remain calm
The end has arrived
We cannot save you
Enjoy the ride
This is the moment
You've been waiting for
Don't call it a warning
This is a war


It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, ayy, ayy
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will, ayy, ayy
Move

I heard they need better signal
Put chip and pins in the needles
Quarantine all of those secrets
In that black hole you call a brain before it's too late
Really we just wanna scream something
Only pretend to believe something
I know you're baying for blood
I wanna turn you around (Hey)

You can lock up your doors, yeah
But you can't keep washing your hands

When all the king's sources and all the king's friends
Don't know their arses from their pathogens
When life is a prison and death is the door
This ain't a warning
This is a war, war
This is a war, ayy, ayy, oh, oh

Do you wanna start a cult with me?
I'm not vibrating like I oughta be
I need a purpose, I can't keep surfing
Through this existential misery
Now, we're gonna need some real estate
But if I choose my words carefully
Think I could fool you that I'm the guru
Wait, how do you spell ""epiphany""?

Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old 
mantra
Yeah!

Could I have your attention, please?
It's time to tap into your tragedy
Think you could use a new abuser
Close your eyes and listen carefully
Imagine you're stood on a beach
Water gently lapping at your feet
But now you're sinking, what were you thinking?
That's all the time we have this week


Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old 
mantra

And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
But do you really wanna think all by yourself now?
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to believe
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
You know you gotta work the corners of your mind now
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to, so easy to believe

Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot

My head is haunting me and my heart feels like a ghost
I need to feel something, 'cause I'm still so far from home
Cross your heart and hope to die
Promise me you'll never leave my side
Show me what I can't see when the spark in my eyes is gone
You got me on my knees, I'm your one-man cult
Cross my heart and hope to die
Promise you I'll never leave your side

'Cause I'm telling you, you're all I need
I promise you, you're all I see
'Cause I'm telling you, you're all I need
I'll never leave

So, you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you

Come sink into me and let me breathe you in
I'll be your gravity, you be my oxygen
So dig two graves, 'cause when you die
I swear I'll be leaving by your side

Hi, are you looking for the other side?
Feel like nothing ever seems quite right?
Are you circling the drainpipe? Getting off on pain like
You're corrupted?
I need to know where your loyalties lie
Tell me, are you gonna bark or bite?
Do you really wanna twist the knife in the belly
Of the monster?

Get the fuck up, wake the fuck up
Wipe the system and back the fuck up
You're a puppet when thеy cut your strings off
Don't come crawling back

S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it, let's go!

I've had enough
There's a voice in my head, says I'm better off dead
But if I sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song, I'll be alright
You want to give up
Gave it all that you've got and it still doesn't cut
But if you sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song, you'll be just fine, 'cause…

Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles

Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles
Don't wake us up, we'd rather just keep dreaming
'Cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles

The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess of hate and unrest
So let's all sing along a little goddamn louder
To a happy song and pretend it's all okay (Let's go)
So let's sing along
Let's sing along
A little fucking louder
A little fucking louder
Well, don't you feel so much better?

That's The Spirit
 Tour Extended Intro]
Sometimes I wonder why are we all here
Call me a nihilist, I guess I'm just unclear
To why I bother, why I try
Death is on my mind so much, it makes me wanna die
I lost my wife this year, we've lost our friend
Always fighting battles, but it never seem to end
Are we just ladders in the world of snakes?
'Cause if life's one big fuckin' game, well, I don't wanna play
So come and sing me, sing me to sleep
I dealt with too much fuckin' shit and now I'm in too deep
Cut off my wings, my flowers bloomed
You want salvation? Well, I'm sorry, we're all doomed


Cut off my wings and come lock me up
Just pull the plug, yeah, I've had enough
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts
You're all vampires, so here

You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my


The world's a funeral, a room of ghosts
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse
Only an echo, just skin and bone
They kicked the chair, but we
We helped tie the rope

You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my

So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade

I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back

You must've made some kind of mistake
I asked for death, but instead, I'm awake
The Devil told me, ""No room for cheats""
I thought I'd sold my soul, but he kept the receipt


So leave a light on, I'm coming home
It's getting darker, but I'll carry on
The sun don't shine but it never did
And when it rains, it fuckin' pours, but I think I like it
And you know that I'm in love with the mess, I think I like it

So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade

I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back
I think we're doomed

So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it

n/A Lyrics

Okay, folks, we've got a new face joining us
Why don't you go ahead and share a little bit about yourself?

Hi, my name's Oli and I'm an addict (
Hi, Oli
)
I'm here 'cause I'm not quite all there
'Cause what used to be my idea of a laugh is
Now just me checking my pulse in my underwear

Thinking I should drop dead, eat shit, go to Hell
I could jump headfirst out the window
Dark thoughts keep on filling up in my mind, oh-oh
Kinda wanna get fucked, make love to a chainsaw
Wrap my drop-top 'round a lamppost
Not sure I'll be coming back down this time

Hello, Oli, you fucking knobhead
Yeah
Did you think you had us fooled?
And, baby, 
I know that I told you I was out of the woods
But I still left a kеy under the mat for the wolvеs

So maybe I should drop dead, eat shit, go to Hell
I could jump headfirst out the window
Dark thoughts keep on filling up in my mind, woah
Kinda wanna get fucked, make love to a chainsaw
Wrap my drop-top 'round a lamppost
Not sure I'll be coming back down this time
Fuck it


Got out on good behaviour
I'm sorry, kid, but I can't be your saviour
I don't know what you expected

So maybe I should drop dead, eat shit, go to Hell
I could jump headfirst out the window
Dark thoughts keep on filling up in my mind
Kinda wanna get fucked, make love to a chainsaw
Wrap my drop-top 'round a lamppost
Not sure I'll be coming back down this time (Time)

Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open
Nothin' could take the pain away

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne

The sticks and the stones that you used to throw have
Built me an empire, so don't even try
To cry me a river, 'cause I forgive ya
You are the reason I still fight

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne


I'll leave you choking on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know (Know)
I'll leave you choking on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know

My secrets are burning a hole through my heart
And my bones catch a fever
When it cuts you up this deep
It's hard to find a way to breathe

Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe

Time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking

I'm at the edge of the world
Where do I go from here, do I disappear?
Edge of the world
Should I sink or swim or simply disappear?

Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe, sing it


Time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking

Wake up
Take my hand and give me a reason to start again
Wake up
Pull me out and give me a reason to start again

Time stands still (Time stands still)
Time stands still (Time stands still)

Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin is smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe

It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again

""And then I found out how hard it is to really change
Even Hell can get comfy once you've settled in
I just wanted the numb inside me to leave
No matter how fucked you get
Sorrow is there when you come back down
Funny thing is, all I ever wanted I already had
There's glimpses of heaven in every day
In the friends I have, the music I make, with the love I feel
I just had to start again""

The days are a deathwish
A witch-hunt for an exit
I am powerless
The fragile, the broken
Sit in circles and stay unspoken
We are powerless
Because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
Silent halls and nameless faces
I am powerless

Everybody wants to go to Heaven, but nobody wants to die
I can't fear death, no longer, I've died a thousand times
Why explore the universe when we don't know ourselves?
There's an emptiness inside our heads that no one dares to dwell


Throw me to the flames
Watch me burn
Set my world ablaze
Watch me burn

How are we on a scale of one to ten?
Could you tell me what you see?
Do you wanna talk about it?
How does that make you feel?
Have you ever took a blade to your wrists?
Have you been skipping meals?
We're gonna try something new today
How does that make you feel?

Hold me close, don't let go, watch me (Burn)
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me (Burn)

Teardrops

We hurt ourselves for fun
Force-feed our fear until our hearts go numb
Addicted to a lonely kind of love
What I wanna know

Is how we got this stressed out, paranoid
Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my head

I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think

I'm tripping on the edge
High as a kite, I'm never coming down
And if you hear me, guess you know how it feels
To be alone


So how'd we get this stressed out, paranoid?
Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my head

I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think

Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ

Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ

I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think
I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think

Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my head
I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think
Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ

Remember when Hell had frozen over?
The cold still burns underneath my skin
The water is rising all around me
And there is nothing left I can give
All these tears I've shed
I saw the wildfire spread
You said you cheated death
But Heaven was in my head

They say ""the good die young""
No use in saying ""what is done is done"" 'cause it's not enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday
What will be will be
Every river flows into the sea, but it's never enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday

No matter what they say
It's like a brand new doomsday

The embers still glow when I'm sober
The gold in the flame burns brighter now
I have to rebuild, now it's over
Maybe now I'm lost, I can live
Souls don't break, they bend
But I sometimes forget
I have to do this for you
And the only way out is through
Yeah, death is an open door


Words the prophets said
Still swimming through my head
Now there's no stars left in the sky
'Cause this well will never run dry
What if I completely forget?
What if I never accept?
'Cause when you fade away
It's like a brand new doomsday
Yeah

They say ""the good die young""
No use in saying ""what is done is done"" 'cause it's not enough

Now the oceans have drained out
Can I come up for air?
'Cause I've been learning to live without
And I'm fighting with broken bones

I wasn't ready for the rapture,
 
we're only passing through
But these words, they mean nothing to me
I know that time will mend this fracture, I've been lost in a maze
And every route I take, leads right back to you

Now the oceans have drained out
Can I come up for air?
'Cause I've been learning to live without
And I'm fighting with broken bones
Now the skies have been blacked out
I've got to find my way
'Cause it's been raining but there's a drought
And I'm fighting with broken bones

I've been searching through the wreckage
But it's like standing in the eye of a storm
When will I finally get the message?
Some things are broken beyond repair
This is my cross to bear
My own meaningless catastrophe
I never had the time to prepare
Because I never knew that all my nightmares could come true


Now the oceans have drained out
Can I come up for air?
'Cause I've been learning to live without
And I'm fighting with broken bones
Now the skies have been blacked out
I've got to find my way
'Cause it's been raining but there's a drought
And I'm fighting with broken bones

I've spent my fair share
In the deepest depths of despair
'Cause I was too lost down there to care
I wasn't braced for the fallout
I wasn't braced for the fallout
I've been searching through the wreckage
But it's like standing in the eye of a storm

As above, so below
Dismantled piece by piece
, what's left will not decease
As within, so without
The seasons bring relief, 
let me live and die in peace

(Let me live and die in peace, let me live and die in peace)
(Let me live and die in peace, let me live and die in peace)

I will be consumed, returned into the Earth
Only passing through, nothing left to hold on to
Like the thaw against the snow, into the undertow
Cut the chord and cast me out, and cast me out

It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Death is an open door
It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Decay's the only law

""Change, and everything is change, nothing can be held on to
To the degree that you go with a stream
You see, you are still, you're flowing with it
But to the degree you resist the stream, then you notice
That the current is rushing past you and fighting you
So swim with it, go with it
And you're there, you're at rest""

It'll wear you down through skin and bone, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own
It'll wear you down through skin and bone, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own

When my heart skips two beats
I am hidden deep, fast asleep
The sea will part where oceans meet
Finally complete


It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Death is an open door
It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Decay's the only law


Swan song, a declaration of endlessness
I swear I will not look back as I return into the black
When the veil lifts, how will I know, how will I know?
Will I see God?

As within, so without
The seasons bring relief,

The weight of my world is resting on thin ice
When the surface breaks, will I find paradise?
As I freeze to death, left to reflect
What a waste of time, I was in retrospect

I'd take a leap of faith, but I'd lose my nerve
In the end, I'll get the hell that I deserve

(I'm always gone with the wind)
(Crawling in and out of my mind)
(God knows I lost all my faith)

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me
 (Inside of me)
You ever wonder how deep you could sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me

(Annihilate me)

Do you remember when you said to me
""My friend, hope is a prison""?
Hope is a prison, blegh


Of all the patterns that I could create
I built a labyrinth with no escape
To keep myself under lock and key
I am my own worst enemy

I'd take a leap of faith, but I'd lose my nerve
In the end, I'll get the hell that I deserve

I'm always gone with the wind
Crawling in and out of my mind
God knows I lost all my faith

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep you could sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me
 (Inside of me)
You ever wonder how deep you could sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me
If I could silence all the doubt in me
Accept that what is meant to be (Is meant to be)
You ever wonder how deep you could sink into nothing at all?

Are you listening? You may not have noticed
We have totally lost our way
It’s ourselves that we will betray
Are you listening? You may not have noticed
We have totally lost our way
It’s ourselves that we will betray
Overflowing with rage, yet we still obey
'Cause we’re asleep in a hurricane
But we're nothing more than royal beggars
Yeah
Blegh
But I'm as guilty as the next man
Our eyes are open, but we're not listening","Royal beggars, royal beggars Do you, do you, do you wanna Live forever, live forever Alone, alone, alone? 'Cause we’re broken All hope is dead, but we're coping Somebody, save our souls Overflowing with rage, yet we still obey 'Cause we’re asleep in a hurricane Bitter lovers, bitter lovers Let go, let go, let go 'cause it's Now or never, now or never Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in 'Cause we're choking And left for dead, but we're coping Somebody, save our souls Overflowing with rage, yet we still obey 'Cause we're asleep in a hurricane Are you listening?

Maybe we'll never learn?
The fire at the gates is our saving grace
Remember we were born to burn
There is a holy hell where we can save ourselves
There is a holy hell where we can save ourselves

We will be cast out of paradise
It's a long ascent out of the black
But we all have to sacrifice, hang the iconoclast
And kiss the feet of the amnesiac
'Cause the moment is dead when I'm lost in the past
   

Maybe we'll never learn?
The fire at the gates is our saving grace
Remember we were born to burn
There is a holy hell where we can save ourselves

But now the rivers are running red
And the skies have been set ablaze
I've been fearing the worst again
Heavenly terrorist, have you been mourning over yesterday?
Don't forget to breathe when the knife begins to twist
Fuck this self-pity, it's not that hard to see
We get one chance, these wounds will set me free 
There's poison on the key, it brings you to your knees


But even the mountains erode in the rain
A single spark can start a forest fire
Light one match and burn down the empire
There's gold buried in the blue, oh
There's gold buried in the blue

Holy Hell, I've got nothing left to lose
And I can tell there's gold buried in the blue

Maybe we'll never learn?
The fire at the gates is our saving grace
Remember we were born to burn
There is a holy hell where we can save ourselves

Holy Hell, I've got nothing left to lose

We are beggars, we are so fucking weak
And once upon a time, we had the world at our feet
Well, we're all dying to meet our maker
But all our gods have abandoned us
All our gods have abandoned us
This is the great esoteric depression
We sold our souls, but couldn't buy salvation

We are all the shades of misery
The reigning champions of tragedy
They use their faith as a weapon
They count our sins by the seven
Blackwater at the gates of heaven
All hail the corporatocracy
The word of God written in binary
All hail our apostasy
The dying notes in an unholy symphony
Blegh!

All our gods have abandoned us
This is the great esoteric depression
We sold our souls, but couldn't buy salvation


I found God clutching a razor blade
He said, ""Look at the fucking mess they've made
They'd trade their hearts if they were made of gold""

Seven billion hungry ghosts
Just a parasite killing its host
The emperor wears no clothes, I see those brittle bones
But we're buried by modern misery
Modern misery

There's not enough water in the world
To wash the blood from our hands
We planted a seed, its roots will suffocate the soul
It grows without light and feeds from our bones
Hell must be empty, all the devils are here
Singing us the Lord's Prayer
Finally, something that we all share

I won't go to the grave with the song still in me

What are we hiding in the rain?
This is a prison for lost souls
Another life circles the drain
We used to run with the wolves
Now we can't see the forest
'Cause there's no light in the black hole
Don't try and tell me we are blessed
We used to run with the wolves


Are these our new messiahs?
'Cause the saviour has a gun to my head
Don't be fooled by Maya,
 
the kings are all thieves
And the serpents will bite as they please
How has it come to this?

I won't go to the grave with the song still in me
And I won't live like a slave begging from my knees

What are we hiding in the rain?
This is a prison for lost souls
Another life circles the drain
We used to run with the wolves
Now we can't see the forest
'Cause there's no light in the black hole
Don't try and tell me we are blessed

Tell me, was it all worth it, to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low, blegh
Sunk this low
(Rotten to the core)

So, who's left to count the cost?
Beneath the ruin lies a story of the lives lost
Now we're gone, left without a trace
But we took something they cannot replace

A match made in heaven
Paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
Cold-blooded retribution
So, fuck your revolution

You chew up peace and spit it out as war
You've been feeding the wolf that's waiting at the door
You are rotten to the core
We found your fingerprints all over the trigger
If you're looking for tyrants, take a look in the mirror, blegh


You knew all along, that the cancer would spread
So, don't be surprised to find a price on your head

Sorry son, but we destroyed your home
We murdered your family, now you're on your own
Collateral damage, face down in the sand
Watch the dominoes fall
It's all just part of the plan

A match made in heaven
Paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
Cold-blooded retribution
So, fuck your revolution
A match made in heaven
Paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
And every execution
The price of your collusion

You knew all along that the cancer would spread
So, don't be surprised to find a price on your head
Tell me, was it all worth it to watch your kingdom grow?

When I leave this skin and bone

And I will know that death is not defeat

Into the night, we burn and rage
In death, we repay for time on this stage
The lights are bright, but don't lose your way
'Cause once it ignites, the flame must decay


Now you're finally complete
I will see you where oceans meet
Past and present merge, light and dark will converge
Time will overthrow our, our reign on this throne

Black Lungs Lyrics

Do you cross your heart when you hope to die?
Are you sleeping deep in the hurricane?
IVs in the arm, forgetting to feel
[Refrain: Sam Carter, 
Sam Carter & Josh Middleton
]
We're 
crawling on all fours
Will you 
fall
 on that 
sword
 at the second coming?
You're gonna taste the ash and dust
'Cause this world is dying in our arms

(Now the wheels are turnin')
(What would you do to stay alive if the planet was burnin'?)

You wanna make your Hell a reality?
Black lungs for the young if they dare to breathe
(If they dare to breathe, woah-oh)
Sure sounds like Heaven to me
You've gotta cut the roots to kill the weeds
No place to go if we don't believe
(If we don't believe, woah-oh)
Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint

Give us a Judas steer we can deify
Yeah, we all pretend we're the renegades
So wash us away, garrotted by a halo

[Refrain: Sam Carter, 
Sam Carter & Josh Middleton
]
Take a bow 'cause 
time's
 running 
out
There's no 
doubt
 that the end is coming
You're gonna taste the ash, you're gonna taste the dust

dying in our arms

And the fucking covenant? (
We'll be waiting

All is not lost, all is not lost, all is not lost, all is not lost
All is not lost, all is not lost, all is not lost, all is not lost

Waiting for a sign washed up on the shoreline
I'll always carry the cross, but all is not lost
I just can't relate a crack in the floodgate
Life comes at a cost, but all is not lost

Is this penance for my sins?
I gave everything for this phantom limb
Holy Ghost, nothing lasts forever
Now it's time to sink or swim
I've got nothing except this wasted hymn
Holy Ghost, nothing lasts forever

Taking back what's mine, but it's lost to the skyline
A bridge I cannot cross, but all is not lost
Now there's no escape; God, what a sorry state
Love comes at a cost, but all is not lost

Is this penance for my sins?
I gave everything for this phantom limb
Holy Ghost, nothing lasts forever

Waters of chaos have invaded all space
The flood on Earth again, I have to find the whales
That once did guide us to the dry lands of life
I won't despair, I'll break this dark around

Under heavy sea
I'll search the flight of whales

Beneath the seas, I searched and had a different view
Of us on Earth, the sinking ship of men
But it's beyond the stars, I found the place where
They were, and they finally came to light

Over the winds
They dwell in light
Like the arrow in the sky I found myself on higher grounds from up here
For I see them all the ways in flight

Now I can see the whales
Looming out of the dark
Like arrows in the sky
I can't believe my eyes
But it's true


Huge tunnel ends in light, like banks of clouds, they gather
See massive shape of flesh, swimming giants in the clear
The mightiest comes to me, I'm on the wing, wide open
They teach me how to fly, slowly moving in the air


So much told with no words at all
Powerful presence for only speech, breath

Stranded Lyrics
The first single released from their album Magma, Gojira present a very strong and emotional track with “Stranded”, showing a very different yet similar approach to their classic sound.

A growing sickness in the heart
Defective, lack of control
The cure is somewhere in the silence
But I'm crushed by the noise inside

Don't lock the door on me
You'd kill me, face down, dead
Another part of me falls for you

Another day in the dark
No, no
Stranded in the night
Stranded in the cold

Don't lock the door on me
You'd kill me, face down, dead
Another part of you gone to waste
Please hear me out
You kill me, face down, dead
Another day in the dark

Don't lock the door on me
You'd kill me, face down, dead
Another part of you gone to waste
Please hear me out
You kill me, face down, dead

Silvera Lyrics
“Silvera” is about societal conformity, the anguish that those who do conform and require others to conform both feel and cause, and the suicides of those who don’t conform to societal standards.

Quit moaning about fate and change
Stand up on your feet and rise
With every fall you get the pain, you learn the lesson
Start now, open your eyes
Dead bodies falling from the sky
We are the ape with the vision of the killing
A rain of shame that fills the mines
No other blood in me but mine

Time to open your eyes to this genocide
When you clear your mind, you see it all
You're receiving the gold of a better life
When you change yourself, you change the world

Your heart is pounding in the brain
As they drag you naked in the mud
A devil's dancing in the rain
How could you fall so low?

No, we will never let go
Let us watch them die

L’enfant sauvage Lyrics
The title track and one of the singles off of Gojira’s fifth studio album. “L'enfant sauvage” means “the wild child” in French, inspired by François Truffaut’s film of the same name.

So long I've been trying to match
It doesn't work, I'm trying, I don't know
The aberration of this world I tried to deal with
It killed a part of me that was raging
The pain is gone, the denial
I ran away from institutions
I owe myself life

There's no way I will risk all this pressure and
Anger flowing through me
There is light in this world I fight for
The reason you won't leave this cage, betray your child
The desire that you once had to reveal yourself
Forgot to create your own life

Anger, lies, denial

This righteous anger boiling inside of us
Won't last forever, don't fear to let it out
Branches have grown through
The wolf is your master


The sky is all over me
I run on time",https://genius.com/Gojira-lenfant-sauvage-lyrics,"So long I've been trying to match

Breathing slowly, mechanical heartbeat
Losing contact with the living
Almighty TV plugged, hybrid empty brain
Don't see anything real in the game
The tension is building constantly
No reason, just a reflex I have, driven by clockwork
I try to keep an eye open, and I realize
I haven't closed my eyes in a long time

Neglected emotions leading to catastrophic voyage on the other side
I have been given so much stress and lack of confidence
I've been given the gift of so small hope deep inside
I haven't closed my eyes in a long time, I am trying

I cannot stomach these forms and colors anymore
But I'm here to continue after all I have been through
I try to keep my eyes open, I am realizing
This life and death more precious than anything

I won't bring no materials in the afterlife
Take no possessions, I would rather travel light

Global Warming Lyrics
The album finishes on “Global Warming” with the character detailing the post-earth/damaged earth and life after his journey.

Four hundred thousand years ago
They came from outer space and gave us life here
And we're just taking everything for granted
I don't think we should do this now
And when I see the smoke around
I feel like I'm not from humankind down there
I feel like glaciers are my eyes
And mountains are my head, my heart is ocean
And I feel all alone
'Cause everybody's wrong
, I fear the living
What is this thing that we call hate?
And that's inside of me, get out of here

A world is down, and none can rebuild it
Disabled lands are evolving
My eyes are shut, a vision is dying
My head explodes, and I fall in disgrace

I hold my inner child within
And tell him not to cry: ""Don't fear the living""
One day you will stand as a king
And no fear can erase this light below us
Each one of us is now engaged
This secret we all have, this truth is growing
And as a warrior, I have to fight
I can already feel the love I'll discover


I had this dream, our planet surviving
The guiding stars always growing
And all the worlds, the fates all the countries
They're all rebuilding at the same time
I never fell and always believed in
We could evolve and get older
Open thy eyes and let all this flow in
Now see a new hope is growing inside

We will see our children growing
We will see our children growing
We will see our children growing

Before all things reborn again

Cold morning stretches out your arms
To the mighty warmth of one golden sun
Seems all have gone insane for gold
All was created out of the night
We're all born from the burst of a star

The day you'll come to life you'll realize
Expanding force of life where you belong
And in the winter cold, with opened eyes
You'll find the strength to fight and stand upright

You'll find the strength to fight and stand upright","Before all things reborn again You learn the painful breath of time Cold morning stretches out your arms To the mighty warmth of one golden sun Seems all have gone insane for gold All was created out of the night We're all born from the burst of a star The day you'll come to life you'll realize Expanding force of life where you belong And in the winter cold, with opened eyes You'll find the strength to fight and stand upright The heart you've been given in winter time And through the bitter cold, with opened eyes You'll find the strength to fight and stand upright"

The Heaviest Matter of the Universe Lyrics
“The Heaviest Matter Of The Universe” details our hero traveling through space, as taught to him by the whales.

Lay down, fall away

Lie awake
Just cannot move my arms and legs, I'm paralyzed
Don't recall how to free myself from this
Heart of the dark, my face contorted
Don't know how to reach the light
But I feel so bad like a freak in a cage

Open the door
Enter your heart
You go so far

Golden unworldly silence
Spaceflight at speed of light
I cross the clouds and colours
The black hole is calling me
Slide on the horizon
On the frontier not to cross
Black dwarf
, time's gone distorted
Heart of the dark, a whirl of light


Enter in the realm of nothingness
I feel the cold, my eyes are shut, my fear is slowly dying
Light years from here are my thoughts and cages
I can hear their moan, but now a long deep breath is calling

Overtaking time and now understanding space
I feel united, I do cross light, feel the living
Here in the centre stands the light of love
That never can be touched from greater silence shall return",https://genius.com/Gojira-the-heaviest-matter-of-the-universe-lyrics,"Lay down, fall away

We leave the shores to see the mountains rising
A distant impression growing
This judgment creates the pain we hold
Destructive intentions that serve no purpose but the end of us all

These vultures from the past, coming
In all the hells and worlds, the time has come
Delivered from their eyes
Embrace, suffer, destroy - the gift of guilt

The shame and sorrow, self-condemnation
Fill all the gaps and the spaces, unyielding
Bestowed upon us, devastating power
We're building connective tissue to a maze of lies

We're left as starving orphans, the vital core is gone
Our sins are all over and over again we swallow
We're sick and tired when this wind blows, the reflex is insane
We must forgive and stop blaming ourselves for this love

Born for One Thing Lyrics

Mortal, spawn on the altar
Caught in the heart of the blaze
The primal fear of disappearing
Becoming a ghost in the void

Give a price, put a name
None of it real in this matter
Wandering, distracting
Wishing the life of another self

We were born for one thing
Tame the greatest fear of all
We were born for one thing
Born to face the greatest fear of all

We're all drawn into oursеlves
In a collective coma
Rеmember gazing up for answers
But now we're staring down

Backbone Lyrics
The protagonist flies to “Sirius” where the ‘master race’ teaches him to restore life on the planet. (Possibly Earth or Mars)

Indestructible
On this rock, I lie, but I'm alive for good
And I just free myself for now from all what was wrong
Break the unbreakable
All the stars fearlessly bright
They call me out there
Order me to face the wind
My structure's alive, body's on the way
Don't bow down before the walls
Of fear and madness
They try to counter me
And strike me down to the ground again


Inexhaustible
The strength of fire is running through me
Spine-like beam of light
What mortal could ever break this force?
Unconstrained
I see at last my backbone straighten
Thy serpent made of bones
Finally rise up from the ground awaken


Beat your feet on the ground now, go

The Shooting Star Lyrics
This song was written as the mother of Joe and Mario Duplantier died.

Joe Duplantier is Gojira’s vocalist and guitarist, and Mario is the band’s drummer.

On the first light of the day, you march on
Departure has arrived, don't look back
Avoid the darkness, stay away, stay out of sight
Until you feel the blast of a shooting star

Following the spark like a rocket in the sky
Between the bear and the scorpion, getting close
Headed north, frozen land where tigers go to die
Don't fear the cold, it'll numb your memories out

You are higher in the sky

Learn the skill to stay alive, survival
The city is so mean, you're being watched
Reach the tunnel, light the torch, you're on the hunt
Until the light calls you back into the wild

When you get to the other side, please, send a sign
It'll fly through the atmosphere in time
And if you hold the truth within your hands
You won't be sent back, through the rain, reborn


Everlasting love is ever-growing
Hang on to what you have and let it grow
Everlasting love is ever-dying
It's in the past, you have to let it go",https://genius.com/Gojira-the-shooting-star-lyrics,"Departure has arrived, don't look back

Go

I'm in a mental cage, I'm locked up
Imprisoned, I live deathlike, sickening
Strong is your hold on my resignation, I
Don't see the stars, my memories are veiled

In fluid dreams, I fall, I'm restless
Walls made of stone are turned into water now
Enlightened demons take by the hand
Approaching me, 
this great eye speaking

Mountainous waves are breaking on my despair
Awaken me, but I'm still dreaming
And I just plunge into this sea of light
Set open the doors of soul I'm living

Lightning struck me
I see the path I was so scared of
And fly to the stars
Conviction now increasing at last
My skin is broken
I see the smallest part of me now
My mind is alive
But I'll never bow to this again


Why do they call me there?
How can I fly?
All this water, I...
I don't feel like I could ever swim to them

Incite a riot, put yourself in a trance
You rotate the frame in a world you rely on
A scar, a line has been drawn in the sand
Behold the life, the boundaries fools will crush

Onto the next stage of the plan
Mourn the witness of the wind
A handful of thunder
Will rise one last time

There's fire in the sky

First song from “The Way of All Flesh,” it is a song very regularly played live.
It features riffs played with tapping, a guitar technique involving using two hands to fret the notes instead of one.

Serpent of light
, movement of the soul
Crawling stately along the spine
Mighty Phoenix from the ashes arises
Firebird cycle of life, regenerate the cell

Life burns fierce, reduced to ashes
Resurrection from the flame,
 ageless process
Quest for absolution, 
out of bounds introspect
Self-consuming womb
, 
ever-present, meet no end

It seems like I always knew this
Since I'm a child, I can feel it
My inner light everlasting
Revolving within a circle
Extended wings I'm flying
Over the valleys and planes
The curve of space I'm leaving
Death is just an illusion

Oroborus symbol of eternal life
Dig a tunnel for light through ignorant walls
I'm counting the days, but I'm dying
Grow up with impatience, I'm falling down
On the peaks of radiant mountains
This truth is growing before me
My attention fixed on this silence

Waiting for you to pull me back in
I almost had the world in my sight

Lost love

Faster than stars falling
How can I tell you that I've failed?

Falling from grace 'cause I've been away too long

I tried to burrow a hole into the ground
Breaking all the fingers and the nails from my hands
The eyes of a child see no wrong
Ignorant bliss, impending doom

After encountering the sultan, the protagonist starts becoming curious about how to defeat him and how to escape the desert. He beings questioning his mortality and what he’s being able to do in this situation.

Running outside the Nazca Lines
You know I see you all in white
Hoping you'll grow the fruitful vines
And the rain to give us life


Violence born within my mind
I know it always takes its time
Climbing inside the cosmic eye
And forgive the enemy

I wonder who I am
Reflections offer nothing
I wonder where I stand
I'm afraid of myself

Watching you crumble to the ground
Made me want to run away
Helping you find the golden crown
Made it easier to stay


I wonder who I am

I wonder where I stand

Toe to Toes Lyrics
I have seen this once before
I have felt these colors
I have known you for so long
When we ran in circles
For our sake
I will wait for you
I walk alone, into the darkness
I came toe to toe and face to face with the beast
He knew me by my name, it was surprising
And he knew everything about me that I despised
I have seen this once before
I have felt these colors
I have known you for so long
When we ran in circles
He had gold and he had silver
He had all the women and wine that you'd ever need
Just one thing, a prick of your finger
Spell your name in the sand and do it with your own blood
Bitten by the fangs of circumstance
Outward light a reflection
We are all equal
Underneath the slab of material
Mutable ways of my fortune
Bitten by my fangs

Gave me a smile, gave me a whisper
Lay me down in linens to watch me sleep
I played the fool
I played the sinner

I played the part of me that no one wanted to see","I have seen this once before I have felt these colors I have known you for so long When we ran in circles For our sake I will wait for you I walk alone, into the darkness I came toe to toe and face to face with the beast I have seen this once before I have felt these colors I have known you for so long When we ran in circles He had gold and he had silver Just one thing, a prick of your finger Bitten by the fangs of circumstance Outward light a reflection We are all equal Underneath the slab of material Mutable ways of my fortune Bitten by my fangs Gave me a smile, gave me a whisper I played the fool I played the sinner I played the part of me that no one wanted to see"

Tired and lost
No one to trust
Who is there to give the push?
All I have learned
Straighten the curve
Like a circle to return

The long embrace
The smell of dirt and roses
Under the sun
No sign of bread or water
I fall asleep under blankets of stars

Ice hit you cold
Heat of surprise
Bending mind can't realize
Faith is in me
End I can see
Tears are strong as ten thousand tongues

My sweet mirage
I bathe in sacred waters
I kiss the Sky
Floating in Sultans' daughters
Memories of loved ones are passing me by
Memories of loved ones are passing me by


Oceans of sand and rust
Give way and yield my wake
Oceans of sand and rust
Give way and yield my wake

They're waiting inside
They're waiting to wash your eyes out
Their hands are alive
Alive with a fervent anger
Your feet have been tied and your tongue in your hand
Death of a thousand ravens
You're down on your knees
You're blind as the Ancient Kingdom

I ain't no good
And I live by the wood
They say I ain't bad
I'm the best they have had
And I know it ain't right
But I'll fight my whole life
Just to prove that I was right
The day it went down
I was out on my path
Not feeling so bad
I'm a suspect now
I'm a vagabond tramp
Living out on the lam
I live by the woods

I'm the best that I've had
And I know it ain't right
But I'll fight my whole life

Terrestrial fire ascending from underground
Godspeed divine
So we control the mound
Shape shifter, spirits whisper
Guide me through this black sorcery

Flashing teeth
Aggressive tendencies
Cloaked beneath
Silver redeems
Smoking mirrors
Black obsidian

From destruction
Make sure no one goes inside

Blessed visionary cut me with your sun
The rivers ran in blood
Spark fueled to fire

Deep within this endless void
Searching for a sign

The vessel forged inside of me
Watches over
Like the death of the moon

Strike the shepherd, sheep will scatter
Mountains of despair

I can see the pain
It's written all over your face

The screaming arrows tear through my soul
In the dawn, your face is haunting
White ghostly dreams of old


Weight of world is on your shoulder
Hear the voice of gold

I can see the pain
It's written all over your face


Violent soul under my control
Violent soul takes its final toll
Violent soul under my control

Guard your heartache well

Don't let them take her down

Part I: Usurper
Don't stay, run away

By the light of the moon
You must escape into the deep black of the night
Fight the devil inside
Enemies poison deep within my second sight

Stretching arms up high

Coursing through his veins
Providing him with strength
To see this to the end
Afraid of psychic eyes
Faith in mystic power
The last baron

Will he save me?

I was standing staring at the world

And I can't see it
All that I have seen
Standing on the edge
The foot of precipice
Floating in the sea
Past the king of swords
Quickly to the shore
The last baron

Ghost of man
Surrounds me in my slumber
I have no fear
As your wing is my shelter
Cyanide he craves
Coursing through his veins
Providing him with strength
To see this to the end

Will he save me?

I guess they would say
We can set this world ablaze

It is hard to see

Roots Remain Lyrics
The fifth track on their album Emperor of Sand, this track paints an epic picture of destruction; a fire running wild, leaving only the roots unscathed.

And the sky opened up and it swallowed us whole
All that's left is time and healing underground
Underneath us the cosmic dawn of war begins
We resolve and watch as it all crumbles down

Beauty fades
Deaths decay
Fires on high
Reach the sky
Branches break
Roots remain
Strong in mind
Beauty

Your adventure is dark and it hides beyond the cells
All I feel alive
, the hearts will prevail
The stolen eye was found and given to the lost soul
While the moon sets far and the milestones seem low

Beauty fades
Deaths decay
Fires on high
Reach the sky
Branches break
Roots remain
Strong in mind
Beauty


And all that I have come to lose
Gone so long it doesn't matter anyway
And all that I have come to gain
Will remain with me until the bitter end
And when you sit and picture me
Remember sitting in the sun and dancing in the rain
The end is not the end, you see
It's just the recognition of a memory

The eyes
The face
The lips
The tongue
The end
The end

Feel the weight of a martyr
It could all be yours
Cut down the altar

Visionaire and deepest fake
Dirty gold, the colours change
Hands are frozen, feel no pain
I just wanna hold the flame

The sickly sweetness is crushing me

They echo, ""This could all be yours""

Dying sun burns in the night
I watch it glow, it's so hard for me
Speaking darkness out of spite
Coercion and then caving in, wrap me in my bitterness
Give it up, I'm complacent
Just enough to escape it
Heretics wouldn't faze me
Lucid trust, I don't want it
Palms are rough when you promise
Fire lies when you're honest

It's hard to lose and wonder why

You pressure in increments
Like a slow-moving coup
Memories dissident
When I am holding you

If my sun won't set tonight
I'll look around, but it's so hard for me
Like a shadow passing by
Crashing into shapes and then fading with my innocence
Give it up, I'm complacent
Just enough to escape it

Jaded Lyrics

(I've always been ashamed that I wanna)
(Fall into a dream with my honour desecrated)
(Blood is jaded)

I feel alone in my body
I feel a silence underneath
In these valleys of blood
In these rivers of rust
Shoulder all the blame again
Mirror locked until the end
It was violent and rough
I was never enough

But what if I was stable enough to wind me down the road
Like a remora swims?
But what if I was inside a thousand lives to give my ghost?
It's never enough, it's never еnough

And I've always been ashamed that I wanna
Fall into a dream with my honour dеsecrated
Blood is jaded
I've never found a way to be honest
All I know is a place where I haunted memories faded
Blood is jaded


In my dreams all I see is 
a crimson key
Tethered by a falling string
Meant to turn in the lock for me
I can't leave so I justify
Interloper of confidence
Under pressure of influence
Not a curse that I caused
Never to rot

What if I was? (What if I was?)
What if I was?
(It's never enough, it's never enough)

And I've always been ashamed that I wanna
Fall into a dream with my honour desecrated
Blood is jaded
I've never found a way to be honest
All I know is a place where I haunted memories faded
Blood is jaded

I know where I wanna go
But you know that it's too close
And you know that it's too late this time


And I've always been ashamed that I wanna
Fall into a dream with my honour

I've never found a way to be honest
All I know is a place where I haunted memories faded
Blood is jaded
And I've always been ashamed that I wanna

I say my blessings all for you
I feel it fade from the inside
I open up to adore you
But everything was just a crutch to preserve life

Serotonin like a loaded gun

Rule of Nines Lyrics

I offer my life
Cursed in this shrine
Broken roots entwined
And I feel my insides breaking down
Bury it in time

I want to be part of light
Detritus
, open up my mind
If that's what you like
Your lesions will blur the line

I, I had a dream of schism, force the rule of nines
Living in premonition, flowing from
The same place I learned to give in
It's such a strange place so full of opposing forces
I, I had a dream of schism, force the rule of nines

In time, I learned the rules of a sadist
Entwined 'til there's nothing left to strain
No body full of pain to take from

They said it's a cruel world
I learned the rules of a sadist
So I lay myself down in the shape of a body
I live in the figurative


I want to be part of light
Detritus
, open up my mind
If that's what you like
Your lesions will blur the line

I, I had a dream of schism, force the rule of nines
Living in premonition, flowing from
The same place I learned to give in
It's such a strange place so full of opposing forces
I, I had a dream of schism, force the rule of nines

String of pearls to keep the bind
Twisting tighter, is it fine? (Can I step outside?)

Insidious by nature
Rewarding sick behaviour

You steal the echo from their ghosts
You pick your teeth with sacred bones
I hate the ones that love you

Yellowjacket Lyrics

Woke from a vision, the plot is still fleeting
I carry you with me
, but I know what I saw
Hole in my head is in the shape of a man
I swear it was an illusion of the retina

Already seen, but cannot access my memories
With repetition in my temporal lobe
Relief is fleeting, I know something is with me
Release the pressure, the leviathan flows

Soma cell
Soma Ross
Nothing saved
Double knot

If I tie up the loose ends into a forceful mechanical movement
Hemisphеre intuition, deal with the light if it doеsn't enter

Where was the grace when I was asking for it?
There is an absence in your phosphenetic
Fear, full of hate, perforates me like a 
yellowjacket
Where was the grace when I was begging? I was asking for it

[Breakdown: Courtney LaPlante & 
Sam Carter
]
I thought the cut was just a laceration (
Laceration
)
Now I recall that it was visual (
Visual
)
It's just a phrase to induce decapitation
Once you taste it and see what I saw
There's no turning back, oh
Soma cell

Where was the grace when I was asking for it?
There is an absence in your phosphenetic

yellowjacket

Sun Killer Lyrics

I was born to break, shallow paradise
Consumed, I ignore meteoric rise
If the blade is dull, there is consequence
You displace the host, there is no defense

Tell me the waves won't rise
And monsters will fade with time
To temper the blaze with the twist of a knife
A sun killer lullaby

They were born of dust, shallow parasite
Breakdown, destruction, ocean floors collide
If the blade is dull, there is consequence
If I stay, I know I'll be violent

Tell me the waves won't rise
And monsters will fade with time
To temper the blaze with the twist of a knife
A sun killer lullaby

Sun killer, sing me to sleep
Sun killer, sing me to sleep
Sun killer, sing me to sleep
Sun killer, sing me to sleep
Sun killer, sing me to sleep

Secret Garden Lyrics

Looking back, you're mistaken
Was it drought or euphoria
That could finally make me
Hopeful in the fault line?
Far from perfect illusion
Wait to walk up the island
Double knot into silence
I could never fall in line
I can feel the rain this time

It flows from the hope spring
Complacent in rare form
You said, ""I'll make you leave me""
Is it all that I am?

And it's you
That I came for
Two hands are guarding my heart
I never climbed this far

And nobody waits for me, but I know
Nobody takes from me what I grow
Secret garden, disregard my heart
And nobody waits for me, but I know
Nobody takеs from me, but I know (I know)


Evidence just to plеase me
Lie awake, uninspired
It could all be so easy
If I could pull out the stitch

And it's you
That I came for
Two hands are guarding my heart
I never climbed this far

And nobody waits for me, but I know
Nobody takes from me what I grow
Secret garden, disregard my heart
And nobody waits for me, but I know
Nobody takes from me what I grow
Secret garden, disregard my heart

Nobody waits for me
Nobody takes from me
Nobody waits for me
Nobody takes from me
Nobody waits for me (I know)
Nobody takes from me (I grow)

Hurt You Lyrics

We are failing in crisis mode
Mutually assured destruction
Love the proxy and burn the bones
So I smile in the snare of devotion

I hope you find what you're fighting for
I am happier when I hurt you
Your medicine is the coldest war
I am happier when I hurt you

Yeah

You just keep on building the tension
I wanna escalate out of this stasis
But you just keep on building the tension
I wanna escalate into the grave

I hope you find what you're fighting for
I am happier when I hurt you
Your medicine is the coldest war
I am happier when I hurt you
So hold me to the grave
That's where you carved my name
I hope you find what you're fighting for
I am happier when I hurt you


(Preemptive, bitter end, perfect fit)
Dysfunction
I have learned to love the embrace
In this mutually assured destruction
It's the crux
Of the coldest war

Perfect Soul Lyrics

(Echoes flow, bury me)

Sharpen your knife upon the stone
Cover me up before you go
So delicate the orchids grow
Buried under melted snow
So I call out your name and let it die slow
I pray that the rain will wash me up
So obvious I can't let go
Carried in the ebb and flow

So cover up the well and leave
A gift to summon the spring
Imitation of a perfect soul
I shine a light into a thousand eyes all watching, waiting

(Echoes flow, deafening)
(Calling up, bury me)

A fortress of eyes and gnashing teeth
In judgment, they're staring back at me
So obvious I can't let go
Of where you buried me


So cover up the well and leave
A gift to summon the spring
Imitation of a perfect soul
I shine a light into a thousand eyes all watching, waiting

Cellar Door Lyrics

Time is always there to catch my fall (To catch my fall)
I carry it in something beautiful (Something beautiful)
I turn the key into my burial (Into my burial)
A cellar door into my open soul (My open soul)

Close the loophole

Who could've known I would fall so hard starting over?
Loop is closed just to go to the depths
Cold mirror

Transform my death into a conduit (Into a conduit)
This body separate from the fear of fear
Inside a coping mechanism of monotony
I will destroy the double vision that I was forced to leave

Close the loophole

Who could've known I would fall so hard starting over?
Loop is closed just to go to the depths
Cold mirror


Thеre is a chain that I don't believе in
There is a strain on the tempered ceiling
Lungs are full of the pain of feeling
I can't live in this world while I breathe in another one

So tear my lungs out
Tear my lungs out

Eternal Blue Lyrics

It's not that you opened my heart
Folding like a reptile, colder in the light
It's not that the agony starts
To pull me like a riptide, pulsing in time
It's one by one, cut the circulation
As the dust settles for you
Flood in the cut will run
An eternal blue sun to illuminate old wounds
I wish my blood would slow down

And what's left of me, a cavity
At least this space is mine
It's where you left me to die
I wish my blood would slow down
You can make my blood rush
Slow down

It's taught that consuming their hearts
Will soothe you like a brush fire, consuming on the incline
Not that thе sediment starts
To hold me likе a sapphire, frozen in time
It's one by one, cut the circulation
As the dust settles for you
Blood in my eyes will run
An eternal blue sun to illuminate old wounds
I wish my blood would slow down
I'm waiting


And what's left of me, a cavity
At least this space is mine
It's where you left me to die
I wish my blood would slow down

Is It Really You? Lyrics

Face away
Deal with the pain
Your own way
How could they deal with the pain?

I knew
It was mine too
And you?
Is it really you?

Let's search the sky for a while
You and I
Collide like two stars for a while
You and I

Crushed by silent snow
Not the first, I know
Caught in ebb and flow
I’m bleeding out, oh, you know

Name a few dimensions
We can flow between with no obstructions
Another timeline, I'd give anything to find
Adorned by countless souls seeking, further untold
At this winter, you will be
And if I join you there, you will ask me
""Is it really you?""

Blood of blood and life of life
Looking through the eyes of a life lived twice
Mirroring emotions
Sharing the same vice
Precious vice

Hoping to find faith
Miming dissolving grace

Few and far between, you appear
Give me the sounds I need to hear
Losing seconds that liberate in tears

Screaming Lyrics
[Verse 1: Kadeem France & 
Erik Bickerstaffe
]
Take a step back
Knowing all that's real
Breathe out
Alone again
Drowning in the noise
The slow learner

Distance in fire that surrounds us
There are pyres all around you
Can't you see?
Do you see them?
[Chorus: Kadeem France & 
Erik Bickerstaffe
]
Distance, leaving
Like the first time, I did screaming
(Like the first time)
Doesn't always have to be so black and white
Pull the wool over my eyes one last time
One last time
[Verse 2: Kadeem France & 
Erik Bickerstaffe
]
Take a step back
Letting go of the fear
Tonight I am 
alone again
All I hear is noise
, deafening
Hopelessly, I have no voice
But I'm screaming
Living in tragedy, in tragedy
And now nothing is how it once seemed

[Chorus: Kadeem France & 
Erik Bickerstaffe
]
Distance, leaving
Like the first time, I did screaming
(Like the first time)
Doesn't always have to be so black and white
Pull the wool over my eyes one last time
One last time

I will write to you
Through the stars and the clouds
With threads in the air
Trade your dreams with mine

A Sad Cartoon Lyrics

In bloom, you sing
Such beautiful colours
What a shame
In this world
That beauty alerts the others

Fray from the light
Till you see it
I'm gone

""Stare into my eyes
I'll show you who I am inside
It's simple, I'm certain from behind the curtain
It's in your hands this time""

What are the odds?
Now that we're falling, colours are swirling
Why were you lost?
Colours are swirling now that we're falling
What are the odds?
Now that we're falling, colours are swirling
Why were you lost?
Stretch to the stars you know
Through tunnels they follow


Inside a room of red
Through the window
Just know you found me
So now you know

""Stare into my eyes
I'll show you who I am inside

I Let It in and It Took Everything... Lyrics
The door is open
Now I'm running away
Comfort waits where I will seek
How to free a light for weeks
Can you see me now?
I've fallen near the end
Can you see me now?
You hold the end
Succumb to shock and fear
To a damned climate drawing near
Extending shadows that grip your mind
To whisper its doubt like one of a kind
One of a kind
Culture in jeopardy
A line drawn and feathering
Cut and spread, force feed the false ego
As you philosophize an enemy
Hallucinations dissolve into the floor
There's no meaning anymore
I see
You are
I see
You are
I see
You are
I see

It's clear you are here
Whilst sharing the same air
I can disappear""

New Faces in the Dark Lyrics

Through fear I move around you
Bearing a weight that suffocates too
Grow beyond amongst the few
You'll suffocate too

A cold soul that's seeking warmth
We tremble when you're near
Caught in between love and fear
Deliver her new face
The former erased
A cold soul seeking warmth

You've spit your poison)

Heavy Is the Head That Falls with the Weight of a Thousand Thoughts Lyrics

Will conquer what you see
The earth had abandoned me in my time of need

Fall through the streams

Crawl through the remains

You missed it,

No window that tempts you to the other side

Time was golden
Falling faster down

Heavy is the head that falls with the weight of a thousand thoughts

Over and over
Over and over

Trapped in loops of suffocating sound

Tearing your soul, screaming just once more

Paint your lies for what they'll see
Have you heard the news?
It's you win then you lose
I can see the signs of what could be mine

Kiss the sky

And stay complacent once more
I believe you'll never find it waiting for more
For more

My mind is free
Eyes are drawn to thee (Drawn to thee)
All I seek, you complete

This path, still mine
I face my last denial


Down on my knees
Pray to the moonlight
For what I need

Gored Lyrics
You'll break
Merciless in full form
A sacrilege conceived in robed black
Impossible to rip apart from it
Listen close, hear it calling for you
It moves through you
There's no turning back
Concentrate
Face to face with what turns
The unsettling fascination opaque
Sick beast spread poison
You are consumed
Run, hide, cry
Nothing will help you this time
Soon trapped by rot and vine

""Nowhere to go, you are mine""
A truth resonates as you fall in endless spiral
Incompetent in disbelief
Reality is frozen
Feel the jaws
Clench and now
Slowly you bend","You'll break Merciless in full form A sacrilege conceived in robed black Impossible to rip apart from it Listen close, hear it calling for you It moves through you There's no turning back Concentrate Face to face with what turns The unsettling fascination opaque Sick beast spread poison You are consumed Run, hide, cry Nothing will help you this time Soon trapped by rot and vine ""Nowhere to go, you are mine"" A truth resonates as you fall in endless spiral Incompetent in disbelief Reality is frozen Feel the jaws Clench and now Slowly you bend"

Broken Vision Rhythm Lyrics
""Cleanse my soul and let the pain subside""
Control, this is the final conquest
Battleground of the mind, time has come to take it
Stolen souls, imprisonment of flesh
Reduced to a drone, time has to take it
Backbone, structure of the world
Propping up the tyrants
The master who would shut you down
Pick apart your bones
Take it back to the start
Take you back to the start
The weight rises in sync
Intoxicated, I can't see
My judgement has failed me
An obsession so deep it burns
Faster
Evade its gaze
Breathe in defeat
Makes sense to follow
The broken vision obsolete
Ruling the end of your world
You stand agape
Chasing this fickle fantasy

Feed from both trails, you psyche cannibal
Birth from devalue
Following testament of the superficial
Abolish this sin now
Forfeit all patience to a bottomless pit
Exhausted, agitated and sick
Reduced to a drone and time has taken it all
The master shut you down, screaming

It’s Yours Lyrics
Claim what's yours
Follow in his footsteps
Loathe as one
Carved into their foreheads
Worship this primal sin
Exhausted, I'm craving more
Incessant, it's pulled me in
Screaming ""it's yours, it's yours""
It's yours
Do you remember me?
Will you ever see?
What you'll do to them
What you've done to me (Done to me)
Follow in order
Do all you can for them
Follow the order
Do all you can
I am unstoppable
I am untouchable
Addicted to this primal sin
Impatient it's sinking in
That feeling I've felt before
I want more, I want more

Do you remember me?
Will you ever see?
What you'll do to them
What you've done to me
Follow in order

Loathe Lyrics
[Chorus: Kadeem France & 
Erik Bickerstaffe
]
No air, our lungs filled with soil and dirt
We have
 exhausted all our options, 
there's nothing left
Hanging on by a thread, they said we're better off dead
Dark days ahead, dark days ahead
[Post-Chorus: Kadeem France & 
Erik Bickerstaffe
]
I can feel how rotten we've become
Body after body, I can smell the decay
Rage against the human race
We built, 
they destroyed
 and left no trace

My vision in true form
See my world; the new world

Our lungs filled with soil and dirt

Forgive me, I can't see
Please breathe life into me
Forgive me, I can't see
Please breathe life into me
[Bridge: Kadeem France &

Born with no voice, 
we'll rip it from their throats

lies where the peaceless struck
Their strongest men will only dream to survive
We'll face this reckoning
 side by side

White Hot Lyrics
I'm under surface
Towers veiled in silk
I guess I'm not welcome
In this house they built
Under surface (Under surface)
Towering veiled in silk
I know I'm not welcome
In this house
A naked soul blissfully dancing in the wind
Immersing in ecstasy
No wondering
A sense my body finds
Feelings and thoughts align
Enough to find
A sense, our bodies' crime
Colours swirl
Tonight, I walk in rhythm
A shift in me, soon you'll see
Our colours swirl in rhythm
We're found blissfully dancing
Pull together, flowing through us now
Moving forward
Oh, somehow

Colours swirl
Tonight, I walk in rhythm
A shift in me, soon you'll see
Our colours swirl in rhythm

Your Head As My Favourite Bookstore Lyrics
I'm neglecting my realm to dissent your repeating line
But according to you all those letters were written out right
Confusing it seems but subconsciously rereading the poem you've had sent to me
It blows a straight understanding of what may and may not rhyme
Inside those pages you've handed down
Beyond this library of our mind
You've found the shelf where our moment was emphasized
You vent it to your blank note
A white paper full of false hope
Here now your chapters are closing
Your sentence is losing its depth to compile each character you're fusing
The words that you're using it felt less amusing
And the syllables failed to describe all my wonder
Sometimes i would sit at the balcony
Pairing all the vivid lights to bear away all those memories
The one that got me stuck on hold while i'm addressing your head as my favourite bookstore
To quote the sole author, i'll rewrite the story where it ends in a halt
I vent it to my blank note
A white paper full of false hope
Sometimes i would sit at the balcony
Pairing all the vivid lights to bear away all those memories

Hear the lightning strike? Did it shake you up a bit?
Whence the downpour drip so gently through the haze
We’ll soothe ourselves in the drizzle and

Have in plan, cause I guess I’ll be gone too soon
I’d like to see what hides behind
The upcoming fate, am I ready to cross the line?
When I peace myself out of here, don’t you even cry

Take Care Lyrics
To stand the test of time, i fantasized a world where our temptations tangled tight
It took me by surprise, as your joy and my pain intertwined
It goes circling around and ‘round

It let the morning rose in the bright of day
Whilst the afternoon stopped and your life turned grey
Before the evening arrives you have constantly strayed
Past the midnight i'll find you through another way around",https://genius.com/Eleventwelfth-take-care-lyrics,"It goes circling around and ‘round

And how my blood is pumping up in an arrhythmical throb

How can i sleep tightly?
Why were you all i ever dreamt about?

Of all the minutes I'd shut just to hold you down

As if your apparition creeps within my tireless scream

(stay here) for a while Lyrics
Here i stay for a while
Know that i’ve been longing for this patiently
Would it be worthwhile? for your effort to quell my anxiety
Do tell, if i need to expound the languor of my demon which drags me out
Here i stay for a while with the evil who i kept permanently
But there you are, in profile
Rally round the venture of my phantasy
A serene fervour, so profound
Arises from upon you, to calm me down
Just let me stay here for a while
Be altogеther with the onliest of you in pairs
Amidst forеver and a brief of nothing flat to spare
Just let me stay here until i die
How i would rather spend the latter with you in this place
Whithersoever, to the aether, everlasting space
Here i just stay until i lay myself down to the ground
At once not for a while
Hither i sway onto what may become the grave of mine

With the Weight of It All Lyrics
Why do we act like nothing will ever draw our attention?
You know i could've known this all along
These pale colour streaks dragged me on repeat with all those blinding tones wrecked me into pieces
Yet i still remain here in forlorn
The image we designed halfway
The illustration marked a certain place
It impatiently just tries to react like nothing will ever draw our affliction
You said “i should’ve known this all along”
It pulls ourselves beneath the theme to trace and retrieve every picture i have thrown
You've got me thinking that i would better to dwell and mourn
If you fill the frame with your splattered paint, you'll step aside with the weight of it all as it bursts right out from your core
The hue displayed a wide range of shade
The saturation caused a glooming wave
The contrast raised above the average
The gradation aligned with my vacant space
It all impatiently just tries to fill the frame with our splattered paint
We’ll step aside with the weight of it all as it bursts right out from our core

Still a Part of Your Home Lyrics
Are all the sparks within our lives flickering in a constant doubt?
We’ve discussed this way too much
We’re a time bomb in disguise, well prepared to explode
Do you feel warmer? Don’t you lie
You raise the temperature, aren’t you now?
Cause we’re heating up inside
Our calescent hearts are might be the whys and wherefores
We burn the candle and let it engulfed in flames
We melt the wax and the fire slowly fades away
As we stare blankly through the darkness, will you stay?
The fluorescent light shines brighter in the night when it follows you home
The incandescent lamp glows dimly every time you decide that you’ll roam
You’ll wander through the stars that’ll guide you safe and sound to wherever you’ll go
I’ll wait with my desire for your return and wish that I’m still a part of your home
When we converse this by and by
If we combust, will we survive? Will our angers reignite?
Set ablaze to our own mind, while we settle the score

Violent Precaution (Silence Awaits) Lyrics
Silence awaits in a violent precaution
Attempting to conceal what I’ve gone through
Violence awaits in a silent precaution
Distracting my decision if i want to take a stance, peek and glance at you, gasping for some air
Breathe in, sigh and respire
Leave you choking
With condolences you stare at my hollow misery
Barely out of touch, merely by the fact you’re no longer where you’ve been
In your transcendental state, will you capture me afraid?
Or will you catch me calm in my plaintive howl?
Leave me choking?
Silence awaits in a violent precaution
Attempting to conceal what I’ve gone through
Violence awaits in a silent precaution
Distracting my decision if i want to take a stance, peek and glance at you, gasping for some air
Strangled by the hurt, smothered by your own limitation to withstand
Any oxygen you take will tear your lungs when you exhale

Strike the lightning in front of your eyes
Thrill the world, illuminate the night sky
Polarising particles clash and that’s how it keeps the thunder rumbling
Flash it back to when every wind starts to roar, then the bolt rolls out of the unknown
Can you overcome all these boisterous sounds?
Only if you weren’t so loud
Strike the lightning twice, leave you startled and surprised
What went around, came around again
A sudden storm spins the cyclone faster
To wreak havoc on things in its way
It undoubtedly tries to erase your mind as it’s slowly crumbling

Like a hippo with It slippery skin
Sliding in the riverside
With a smile on his face
Now its time for the muddy waters
To take cover him from the sun
What a joyful ride
Before he think that he should find out a better place
Traveling, just go on
Night and day
Finally he found a fairyland surrounded by plenty grass

Fully greenery
Abundance of colors
The scent of a flowers and the breeze is light so calm
Sunshine behind
Evergreen pines, take a moment to notice
The sun comes out and the morning dew
Birds fly
Round and round

But honestly, he really miss the old place
Now he leaving all but hesitant

I kinda just called to hear your voice
, so
Your voice recording was enough
Ugh, I should hang up, what am I doing? Um
So uh, I feel kinda dumb, but uh
I miss you, I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about our love and how much I miss your touch
I miss being around you, hearing your laugh and holding your hand
I think of you every day
I hope and I wish that you're doing okay
I want us to go back to the old days
Because, I miss you, and I just thought of you, so I thought I'd call you
To tell you that you crossed my mind and I took that as a sign, that I should call and say hi
So that's all, hi
I hope you don't think I've lost my mind, I hope you don't think I'm crazy
This message is getting long so I should just say bye, but
The idea of you listening to this, the thought of you on the other side of the line
I can't hang up
I'm in your city tonight
And these lights make me feel so inspired

I tell myself, ""It'll be alright""
Now it's 3 A.M. and I still got no reply
But I spend my nights alone
(
Trill got that juice, nigga

By myself, just another lonely day
Do I need help, because this ache won't go away?
These shadows on my wall, my only curtain call
The crowd goes silent now
Waiting for you

Where you at right now? Let me pull up and let's talk about it
I finally got some time alone and I thought about it
I swear to God your love is war, it's so much I can take
I been thuggin' for so long, bae, give me a break
Late nights, I reminisce about you, it's hard to forget about you
I swear I can't live with you, but I can't live without you
Jump off a plane on an island and I'm here without you
Ain't left my hotel in three days, I feel sick without you, sick without you
My stomach do this turning, I feel sick without you
My closest friend my worst enemy
I'm not okay when we apart, but I pretend to be, I

I threw the party of the century
And people came over, no one left sober
And it was all for you
It was all for you
I been under this rock for so long
, don't let the world in
Close the door, don't let the world in
Let's go and hide in again
Rekindle our flame and light my fire again
Oh, come light my fire again

Boyz Don’t Cry Lyrics

Oh-woah, oh-woah
Look, uh

Tour bus slidin' in the rain, headed out of state
So much goin' through my brain, I can barely think
Sometimes I get on my own and wander outer-space
I love you, but I'm full of rage, our past is full of pain
On a planet of my own, livin' like an alien
Think it's safe to say that I'll never be the same again
Never fall in love again, my heart is on a shelf
My music's full of pain, but I keep my problems to myself
And I keep my mouth closed 'cause my thoughts sometimes can get too deep
My heart cold, my eyes closed, but I never go to sleep
I been all alone goin' on two weeks me, mysеlf, and my sheets
Wanna call your phone so we can speak, but it makе me feel weak
Get on the internet and see the world laugh 'bout my depression
They paintin' perfect pictures, but I ain't buyin' what they sellin'
Collect calls from the county always could make me smile
Damn, brother, you was just on the streets, and now you goin' to trial
Yeah, mama, I made it out the streets, I hope you finally proud
Youngin' jump out with that K, in broad day, shootin' at the crowd
Now he gettin' on top the stage, and they sing his music loud, sing his music out loud

Take away my name, take away my throne
Take away my fame, let me keep my soul

Smilin' on the outside, inside dyin'

Letter From Houston Lyrics

 eyes staring back at me (Back at me)
My heart starts to skip a beat
I pray that you will never know
 (Never know)
I fall and then you look in my eyes

Yeah, I'm sad
I love you
I love you too

I wrote this song for you, so you should pay attention
I was just staring at the ceiling and got in my feelings
Reminiscing about us fighting, fucking, and chilling
Right now, I'm riding through Memphis, passing through the city
I'm with my niggas, but I miss you, girl, don't get it twisted
And I cannot wait 'til I see you, hug you, and kiss you
Remember when I had first met you how I used to sweat you
I used to call your phone and text you and tell you you're special
Like girl, you're special, you the kinda girl that I need
I actually made you mine, sometimes, I can't believe
Wonder what your nigga was thinking when he let you leave
You try to leave, I might get down on my hands and knees
I'm still a G, please believe, but girl, you make me weak
You make me feel something I never felt, the reason I never left
A lot of hoes want your position, but they tripping
You been with me since the beginning and that's the way I'ma end it


But just in case you feel you cannot stay, babe
Cars, clothes, and hoes, I'd trade it all
For a guaranteed spot in your heart
Wonder
 do you miss me when I'm busy on the road?
Wonder
 do you hear me? I'm in Houston all alone
And I'm thinking 'bout you, yeah, yeah
I been thinking 'bout you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just in case you feel you cannot stay, babe
Cars, clothes, and hoes, I'd trade it all

I made the first one but I did not make the second show
Yeah, uh

It's safe to say I been this way since I was eighteen
The same night I fall in love, I feel it fading
Who can you love, who can you trust now that you're mainstream?
Don't want no love, don't got no trust, I feel me changin' (Yeah)
Sometimes I think about my high school sweetheart (Oh-oh-oh)
But times change, people change and grow apart
I fell so hard and fast for Dee, I wanna start a family (Family)
She show resentment, she got pregnant, and she felt abandoned (Oh-oh-oh)
That shit with what's-her-namе was faster than I had planned it (Oh-oh-oh)
She movеd away from San Diego, livin' in Miami (Miami)
We caught a flight to Puerto Rico, she was sweet as candy (Candy)
She just ain't know she had my heart before the plane landed (Yeah)
And by the time I got home (Oh-oh-oh), I just wanted to be alone
I met Brianna through Kearra, they were the best of friends (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
She turned her head, and we moved up just like the Jeffersons (Yeah)

I need your all each and every day (Oh), if I can't then I'll fade
And I don't mean to rush, but I easily fall in love (Yeah)
Uh, in my head I know that that ain't right
But I believe in first sight, yeah
We can fall in love right here tonight
Run away and be together for life
No more cold Decembers, lonely cold Decembers
No Decembers, lonely cold Decembers (Yeah)
No more Decembers, lonely cold Decembers (Yeah)
Cold Decembers (Yeah), lonely cold Decembers, yeah

Mmm (Grrah), yeah
Uh, uh-uh, yeah
Uh, uh, uh-uh, yeah
But I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name
I guess you could say that my love life was not up to par
Too many nights alone had left some permanent scars
She told me she'd love me and I told her that I'd do the same
Then I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name
Then I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name
I brought it on myself and I guess that I shouldn't complain

Pipe that shit up, TnT
Where the fuck is Rod Wave?
Hey

It's November, where the fuck is Rod Wave?
Young nigga way outta state
Fucked up, gettin' over pain
Look how far a nigga came
You remember I ain't had a thing
Fucked up, walkin' through the rain
At the top of the game, should've seen the niggas I was tryna bring
It's crazy the way these niggas change
Tell the city girl chill, you know baby mama know the deal
She know I could beat that pussy
Okay, let's switch the subject
Notice that both of my wrists is flooded
I been grindin' so hard, gеttin' to this money
I been working like I know the drought is coming
Monday to Monday, Sunday to Sunday, you know I'm street running
Okay, my daddy was a gangstеr, what the fuck that made me?
Niggas claiming that it's love dawg but it can't be
Know I fell in love with guns by the age of thirteen
And my pocket rocket on me, homie don't reach
Fuck dying in my Cuban link, I'm living in my Richard Millie
I just finished my tour, what a wonderful feeling
I got inside my bag and got out my feelings
I'm out my feelings


Hey there everybody, what's it like in your city?
I'm a thousand miles away but look, tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do, oh
Times Square couldn't shine as bright as you
I swear, it's true
Look, look
Hey there everybody, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right here if you get lonely
Give this song another listen, close your eyes
Uh, listen to my voice, it's my disguise
By your, your side
By your side
By your side, yeah, yeah

He just came home, he still packin' his pistol
Die in these streets or get saved by the system
Or get you some millions, my lifestyle is vicious
These hoes ain't gon' miss you
They fuck on your partner, act like they forgot you, that shit have you sick
My girl, she the realest, I know how to pick 'em
I know what I did, I need you to bear with me
I know shit get ugly, but that's why you pretty
And pushin' a Bentley, my kind near extinct
I put up them millions, I'll never go broke
I'm a god in my hood, I give everyone hope
Can't remember a time when my answer was nope
I remember the times I had nowhere to go
Down to my lowest, I turned to a pro
And I'm pourin' my heart out, I bought my lil' boy house
I brought all the bros out, I never try show out
I'm never gon' go out, never that
Every time that I turn around, I'm giving back
Once they whack him, he's dead, it ain't no gettin' back

I had blue hearts at first, I had to turn 'em black

25 Lyrics

Uh, uh-uh, uh, uh
Oh, do you do this often?
I know it sound wrong, like, everything I left in Maryland
I just don't wanna see myself anymore, I don't
They, like, they say they miss me and shit, shut up, for real, like, man
Look, 'kay

DJ, run it back, play my song in this bitch
Vibin' like I'm alone in this bitch, mm
Tit for tat, I got you back, was I wrong for that shit?
Tell me, is we too grown for that shit? Uh
I wanna lock it in, baby, no weighin' my options
Wanna travel, see the world, gettin' drunk on an island
Wanna settle, start a family, so tell me about it
And you so perfect, baby, don't give nobody that body (Okay)
Social anxiety, I fear
And I done been this way for some years
I don't really get along with my peers
Everything that they do to me is weird
So in a world full of weirdos, fools, and scrubs
Tell me, what is it you're willin' to do for love?
You know it's true that the datin' pool is fucked
Ain't nobody out here, baby, it just be us
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know a broken heart when I see one
And I feel, and I feel, and I feel, and I feel like I love you more
Did you know? Do you know? Did you know? Do you know I'm a shoulder if you need one?
When I feel what I feel, keep it real, what’s the deal? I'm ready for
Go somewhere we could be alone, you and me alone
I remember bein' twenty-one when my life had just begun
Twenty-two, many things to see and do
Twenty-three, lookin' forward to twenty-four
Is it just me or it ain't no love no more?
Twenty-five, what a time to be alive
Am I getting old? Why do I feel tired?
All the same old things, the same old games
Same old pain, think it's time for a change 'cause
Certain shit ain't like me no more
Certain shit don't excite me no more
It don't excite me no more, no
It ain't like me no more
No more, no more
No, no, no, no, no

Tonight I'ma pray it's better by tomorrow
Say mama, hey, mama, I been feelin' homesick
It's demons inside my heart and I can feel 'em growin'
I brought people around me without even knowin'
They all had secrets agendas that they wasn't showin' (Showin')
Bitches will stab you in yo' back but smile in yo' face (Face)
Niggas will act how they act but they want yo' place (Yo' place)
Say that's it's love out they mouth, but that shit be fake (Fake)
So I been lookin' for peace and beggin' for space (What up?)
And, Lord, I'm just a nigga tryna win, uh

Then niggas come around with that energy
Make it even fuckin' worse, I don't even⁠— man, I be⁠—

Poison Lyrics

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, that's probably Tago

She had to tell the world we had a
You know what I'm sayin', with the, uh

Had to tell the world, you know what I'm sayin', you ain't really fuckin' with me
You know what I'm sayin', you a fan, bitch
Ayy, of all these, man, I'm dolo, thug life
Uh, yeah, uh

And I don't want no more love, I feel it's poison
Late at night I can't sleep 'cause I hear voices
Tellin' me I'm too deep, quit tryna force it (Uh, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Got too much stuck on my chest, can't get it off of me
I put my demons to rest but they been stalking me
Lord knows I tried my best, I gave it all of me
 (Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)

Late at night, I been roaming, I ain't getting no sleep (Woah)
It's hard to stay focused when that pain running deep
Been alone my whole life, but you helped me forget
Then you made me remember my heart cold as December
Learning to love myself, I been alone every weekend
They say he's out of breath 'cause he's been runnin' from demons
You left, I needed help, you were someone that I believed in
People change like the seasons, I'm asking what's the reason?
Then I been thuggin' dolo, lay in my bed and cut off my phone
I smoke that dope alone, me and others don't get along
You can peep the pain in my face but I hide it deep in these songs
I learned to keep my mouth closed 'cause don't nobody know what's wrong
Got me addicted to love, and then you left 'round the same time
Sorry I can't make time, been living on space time
I heard through the grapevine she told you we FaceTimed
That shit got a block, tell that bitch to kick rocks, yeah, yeah


And I don't want no more love, I feel it's poison
Late at night I can't sleep 'cause I hear voices
Tellin' me I'm too deep, quit tryna force it (Uh, yeah-yeah-yeah)

Middle of the projects with my gun in my hand (
12Hunna on the beat
)
Most don't have a choice, so we choose to take a chance
Gambling
What you gon' do when it's time to feed your family?
You gon' go handle it by gambling (

Gambling, gambling, gambling, hey
It's hard to focus on your grind
When you got everything on the line
We gambling

God, come and take me out, this side all wrong
I don't wanna live here no more, oh, I
I don't move around, then they gon' kill me in my home
The ones you known to be around not on my side
I don't fuck with niggas, never did, why would I lie?
Big dawg who? You got me fucked up, that nigga know he tried
I move 'bout results, not 'bout friends or things that's televised
Up or it's down, handle it like men, nigga, I ain't never hiding

I'm in that Bentley, me and my youngest son
He too young to understand, but we still having our one-on-ones
Ecclesiastes, I told him everything done under the sun
They'll kill you when you speak the truth, thug you when you playin' dumb
I die today, then I'ma leave out somewhere in my Rolls, yeah
Somewhere in the 
Woodlands
 in a big home, yeah
Since I been a child they knew what I'm on (I'm on)
Know 
you seen niggas dying on your iPhone


Hurting you when I smile, oh
I might stall, but I never lie, no
I see, they don't deserve me
Truth what I speak, they wan' murk me
Tell me, tell me
Somebody, can you please tell me?
Why the fuck I feel I'm the only speaking up and that's on my own?
'Fore I bow down to these niggas, I'll have my funeral in they town, yeah

Got a burden on my heart and it's a burden on my mind
Suicide from pain on movies I done seen plenty times
Tired of fucking 'round with groupies
Four lil' boys and two lil' girls and they mine
Life misplacement, blood shooting out, now that's some shit for my eyes
Shawty dying, Glocks on my mind, I'm being framed right now
Who did it? Admit it if they get it, how to carry on with my life
Seen Pat wasn't right, but still now, what the fuck I'ma do 'bout a wife?
Ya
 left her ring through the night
My heart wouldn't act right
Trying to explain so she can leave
Fucking with these bitches, tryna run you far from me
'Cause if somethin' was to happen to you, I wouldn't even wan' breathe

She say, 'Why you thug me like that?'
I don't mean to
Sometimes I feel like I don't need you
Unlike other people, I done been here twice before
So I know how the dices roll
So many times I had the chance to tell the truth and played you
So many times you could've went and did you, but was faithful
That's why I wanna thank you and then give you the best of me
I can't take back the past but I got the recipe
Let's jump on a plane, see the world together
Give you my last name, be my girl forever
They see the Instagram, the comments, and all the likes
But they don't see the make-up, and the breakups, and the fights
It's a cold, cold world, it's a wild, wild life
But long as I got you, girl, I'm alright
In the middle of the day, at the end of the night
Believe me, I'm right by your side
So if you need me, you can call me
I'll be running for you, darling
Whatever it is, whatever you need
I'll come full speed, guaranteed to...

How much time I've wasted in  life
It will never be back again
I've just passed the hardest time
And the others are waiting
It might be so easy for you
I wish i could be you
But you're the one who strengthened me
So please don't leave me
While the others are living their live
I've just lost mine
You say i'm so pathetic
You don't need to say it

Admire Lyrics
Why do you always wear that jacket?
Have you try another place to hangin out?
Why do you sit there by yourself?
I wonder what songs you’re listening to
I feel like i know everything about you

I know how it feels to be you
But i don’t want you to know...

I feel blessed when you're around

Graduation Lyrics
I know we were both so emotional
Separated by the times and distance
We cry like we never cry before
We are both just so emotional
At the room when the yellow light illuminates us
While we talk about
Our day all night long
How can I forget?
Your tiny fingers, your sparkling dark brown eyes
If I could embrace you one more time
I'll do whatever it takes
But who the hell am I?
Our day all night long
How can I forget?

An imperfect mangrove, Pt. I Lyrics
I hate those times
When I wanted to reach you
We met in odd feelings
And that fated talk might not have affected yours
It won't be real cause I'm frightened
(At the future)
And then, the next page was probably a hope about
How could I win a laurel in my own eyes with you
But that was just another wish you gave me
You hold back the puzzle between your dreams
Cause until this time it's still uncharted
To talk about the trust in your mind
I just know that the blueprint is on his hands
I won't be able to notice
Open your baffled eyes
Open your eyes
(The ocean draws hollow, The blue repeats pity notes, The sound makes wounds, The stream mourns senses)
On my distressed frame
Oh, I'm letting you drown me down

Oh well, the next page’s probably a blank page about
How could I just weep to what our recollections were
If there's another hope you would give me
To let me live a spark between your dreams
Cause until this time it's still uncharted

Our passions are starting to unattached Lyrics
You're the eyes of the places i couldn’t reach
You're a eucalyptus between the havoc
You illuminate, mesmerized every evening
But i'm a tornado circling your house
Would you have still hung around?
Would you have still picked up the flower (after the rain stopped)?
You’ll see, i am those problems
I know it feels bad, but my egos are rad
‘cause i just hope, (you're at ease in being east)
After that, (you could play with my soul forever)
‘causе i'm okay to waste it, but your time will swallow
You've talkеd a lot of dreams, keys, and phrases
And i've seen you making colors
You're even throwing glitters between my nerves
So let me stay to see me be consistent

The future is a raffle to go stale Lyrics
If your eyes can fumes these paper walls
Will you set the fire?
And someone who grant you all these fixes
You just leave her out locked?
Cause nobody tells you right or wrong
So, you'll be a robot?
You know, they will always roll the dice
There's still no twenty one
No matter how I swim
(I can't see the shore)
Old ships are built in hundred years
But why
Now they work like thunder
Did anonymous text puzzle us?
I broke the door
To escapе the realm
But why does hе put me on loop?
(They're clicking fast
All the glitches of my time)
Hey, transparent box
Will you leave the keys for me and see my false numbers?
And so, I can navigate the house and bring it over the moon?

The river is pouring in
The love is quenching out
Miss, you're a fantasy
In other life, we're dancing until times broken
And the terrace's green
So what's on the other side?
We call back some memories with hope to be worn out in days
If there was a prize for us after this, why is there nothing but being lost for so long?
So, here I'm just spinning luck for every odds
While rueing my lack of flair

The soldiers that generate farewell Lyrics
We're getting old, but not our prudence
Sensibility is only in our mind
""What if ..."" are only words we never consider
And we are afraid to change lane
It bears on me too since I was eighteen
But it's hard to cope with, and it is hard to leave
This cage has a beautiful scent
While our scenery is full of sore and sorrow
Then you have to choose a branch on a single tree
We lead by our marks on plucking stars
I'm holding back to open the door
Because lights are coming from homes that tip its hats
And these ropes tie tight, and I still can't find a way to loose these knots
Everyone says the same thing, that we are the soldiers that generate farewell
Then we live our life by ourselves and only for ourselves until the end",https://genius.com/Hulica-the-soldiers-that-generate-farewell-lyrics,"We're getting old, but not our prudence

Semua terjawab

Menatap sesal
Bermain frasa

Menggenggam tenang
Sorot mata tak lagi sama, pejamkanlah
Terjawab dalam bawah sadar
Meratapi setiap intensi kehilangan esensinya
Mengulang kembali seakan tak pernah layak bersinar
Dalam gelap dia bergumam
Lepaslah…
Teruntuk renjana yang terkekang sembilan ke lima
Terlambatkah jika hentaknya tak begitu terasa
Pilu yang tersamar dengan anggunnya
Bertaruh dalam tarung yang dia rangkai
Mungkin sеjarah tak akan pernah berpihak

Hokkaido’s electone girl Lyrics
Bring me there
I don't know how I should be
Cause I am so far away to hold perfection
I'm waiting and it goes blue
We surely talk in riddles
And then it always makes me hate you
Because you don't even see
Time's running out and i'm stranded here
I'd make you home
And then you'd see all decorations
The air was fresh, flowers were bloom, but then..
How dare you did that and cut it off?
You even abandoned your poems
Left all your beautiful wings and then you made it gray
(Your perfume scent didn't last much longer)
And I wonder like you did
Be fine with bread and butter
Then a dead cat will bounce in
But... I still remember when
I'd make you home
And then you'd see all decorations
The air was fresh, flowers were bloom, but then..
Why were the candles fading out?
You held the wrong end of the stick
And pushed me hard to touchdown the north, but dear..

Neglected warmth Lyrics
I still remember when you asked me
(To walk) the pavement together
Then we talked a lot about why the skies painted blue
And the smell of your parfume you left in my room
I shed a tear right at the red colour of it
Why did you do this?
The scent just won’t leave
Even if I threw the bottle
And then why the days seem leaving faster?
I knew that I won't be a part of your embrace
Thе story all ends here
Thеn, as I thought, you said goodbye
And also I heard me say ""I'm fine"", relentlessly
Are you grateful to seal my hopes back to the jar?
Please take the ache away, even if
(I know) it won't get any better
Cause you said, ""I would be a pain for you since the start""
But, please take a gaze to me
My life hasn't been easier since I let my eyelids swell, without a smile
(You tore up my frame)
I knew that I won't be a part of your embrace

Then, as I thought, you said goodbye
And also I heard, me say “I'm fine"", eternally

Beyond/untold Lyrics
(A relentless threat)
(Spreads wide open)
(Will everyone admit)
(The lost and the violent?)
Treason of a reason is unforgivable
It's an outrageous act to divide us
It won't be affected, because it will grow in our deepest sense
As it spreads wide upon the root to the tip of our backbone
So, embrace its seed, as the quintessential essence which will start to stand
That's all it takes either to bleed or to bloom
On a singlе line that haul us, a divine masterplan was prеpared to be demonstrated
(Surreal, uncontrollable, its desire to kill)
The instincts are recalled and reshaped to avoid those false intuitions that were implemented beneath our senses
(As time began to move, does these sensations burst as the heart stops crashing?)
Then it would be a backfire among us
(What lies beyond is unpredictable)
And after that, these bizarre perceptions will last longer than we were expected
(And the untold truths are set)

Tak kunjung jua
Tuhan yang t'lah kutinggal
Yang berujung terangnya derita

Dihantarkan luka

Tak pahami perinduan

Tak seperti terik puan

Terikat, tak senyawa
Serikat sirna asa
Oh hampa

Bertanya ada apa
Tertawa tak bahagia

Pintu jamah halus nanarku
Merepih dan merayu
Terisak kan dalam ragaku
Mencair dan membeku

Dibuai

Darah tulang pada tubuhku
Meletup bagai abu
Saat terang mata beradu
Terusap jemariku

Syarat di balik desir
Tanpa arah

Seek Lyrics

I long for the light to veil upon me
As I voluntarily participate in some dark trickery
Sins fall upon a novel mockery
Hazy skies deceives a heart full of another's misery
Leave it up on the grounds where it never will ever own

Leaning on
Swayin' long
The bigger arc going to sovereignty
Pleading all what would be an entity

I bid a lot for your ascendancy
Longin' for that unexplained exclusivity
Swallowing the ocean that I brought within
A white mist of silence they unfolding
Harrowing the motion that you couldn't see
Stark-eyed, chasing all of these mysteries

Leaning on
Swayin' long
The bigger arc going to sovereignty
Pleading all what would be an entity
Mist of silence unfolding
Stark-eyed, chasing all these mysteries
Take it in, and wear it all around
Bring it in, all the world now they can see



Take it in
And wear it all around
Bring it in
All the world, they can see
Take it in
And wear it all around
Bring it in
All the world, they can see

(Form will born, even wrong)
(Leaning on, swayin' long)

Leaning on

Yang kan terbang
Biarkanlah perjamuan
Hendak melaju dalam batas cahaya
Malam yang kan terang
Agungi dalam hati
Pahami rasa lirih
Kabut multidimensi hari
Agungi dalam sendu
Pahami rasa itu
Kabut multidimensi waktu
Dari yang gelap (ketika lelap)
Dari yang kelam (di tengah malam)
Dari yang hitam (pusat temaram)
Dari yang indah
Aku gelap, kamu serap
Aku gelap, kamu serap
Aku serap, kamu gelap
Aku gelap, kamu
Agungi dalam hati
Pahami rasa lirih
Kabut multidimensi hari
Agungi dalam sendu
Pahami rasa itu
Kabut multidimensi waktu
Dari yang gelap
Dari yang kelam
Dari yang hitam
Dari yang indah","Lyrics of ""Dim"" He is the one who has promised The ripple of fingers increasingly clashing In the spur of the constellations Leave the meeting alone Want to go within the limits of light It's a calm night Honor it in your heart Understand the soft feeling Multidimensional fog of the day From the dark From a dark heart From the dark core Nobody drowns In the image of a whisper of dreamland The one that flies Let the banquet be Want to go within the limits of light It's a bright night Honor it in your heart Understand the soft feeling Multidimensional fog of the day Glorify in sadness Understand that feeling Multidimensional fog of time From the dark (when asleep) From the dark (in the middle of the night) From the black (dim center) From the beautiful I'm dark, you absorb it I'm dark, you absorb it I absorb it, you are dark I'm dark, you Honor it in your heart Understand the soft feeling Multidimensional fog of the day Glorify in sadness Understand that feeling Multidimensional fog of time From the dark From the dark From the black one From the beautiful"

Lovers Lyrics

Lovers shares a secret
And keep it from the underground
With dawning answers, rejoice
Underneath we begin to fall
Let silence take you to the core of life
And all your talk is worthless
Compared to the One

Lovers shares a secret
Then we try to understand
With dawning answers, rejoice
Underneath we begin to shine
Let silence take you to the core of life
And all your talk is worthless
Compared to the One

He breathes into my ear
Oh, how can I escape?
He'll melt you with your pride
Make you thin as strand of hair
Breathing inside your chest and
Searching for paradise

Malam Lyrics
To be honest
Can't relate to Anyone that i love
Had to admit shit the feeling is rough
Compensate by telling all of me my paycheck's enough
I know im sinking in quicksand of my own mental faults
I know you thought of me as nothing at all
I know my soul gone when i feelin it crawl out of the sheets
Lately ive been struggling feeiling cold head to my feet
Dismissing everybody in terms of what i need
I need myself to stop taking everything seriously
I need that old man wine borderline promethazine
I need that mild and a couple of lighter one is for keeps
A leap of faith is all that i need
A little warning know that i never heed
Never haste even when the sun hits my face
To be honest this what i do day to day thats just the case
Just another ghost in the shell
Just another motherfucker
That be talking to his sink
Like a brother that always pays for his drink
Shouldve cared what u think
A rare breed to all of us that feels i should be extinct

In a circle that sees red when its pink
A different prism i close my eyes
And all i see is just a different prison
Mustve change when it hit em
All i hear is my own thoughts saying that i dont need em
Come to think of it
I haven’t hung with friends man i sure miss them
I really hope they got the time to just sit and listen
Cus my friends are doctor
All they fucking do is write prescription
For your problems
And still let you do brass decisions
Cus they can’t solve em
And i can’t either
Cus life is weird and
It keeps getting weirder
So please understand
If getting help isn’t really what i plan
So i apologize
If im not being myself
Im tryna key myself out from this personal hell
Being here before god starts ringing my bell
Cus when im gone please know i do wish u well
And i apologize
If im beyond any help
And the times i disregarded every part of my health
Every cigarette every whiskey everything else
Cus when im gone please know i do wish you well


You were out of time
Falling out of line
In the shades of night
Breathing for the light
Set your heart on fire
Burn them, see it glows
Place your hand on time
Don't rush, let it roves",https://genius.com/Bap-idn-malam-lyrics,"To be honest

I went away
To find composure

I found my place
Through all emotions
Swollen and hollowed
Captured in glowing glass
So I will deny

I hear it falls

Flustered and watered

To fall down

When we’re 21
Will we lose our sight?

Peradaban Lyrics


Bawa pesan ini ke persekutuanmu
Tempat ibadah terbakar lagi
Bawa pesan ini lari ke keluargamu
Nama kita diinjak lagi
Bagai keset ""Selamat Datang""
Masuk kencang tanpa diundang
Ambil minum lepas dahaga
Rampas galon, dispenser pula
Yang jadi saksi harus kuat
Tak terbutakan dunia/akhirat
Yang patah tumbuh, yang hilang berganti
Gapura hancur dibangun lagi

Karena peradaban takkan pernah mati
Walau diledakkan, diancam 'tuk diobati
Karena peradaban berputar abadi
Kebal luka bakar, tusuk, atau caci maki
Karena peradaban takkan pernah mati
Walau diledakkan, diancam 'tuk diobati
Karena peradaban berputar abadi
Kebal luka bakar, tusuk, atau caci maki


Beberapa orang menghakimi lagi
Walaupun diludahi zaman 1000 kali
Beberapa orang memaafkan lagi
Walau sudah ditindas habis berkali-kali

Karena peradaban takkan pernah mati
Walau diledakkan, diancam 'tuk diobati
Karena peradaban berputar abadi
Kebal luka bakar, tusuk, atau caci maki
Karena peradaban takkan pernah mati
Walau diledakkan, diancam 'tuk diobati
Karena peradaban berputar abadi
Kebal luka bakar, tusuk, atau caci maki

Karena kehidupan tidak ternodai
Maknanya jika kau tak sepaham dengan kami
Karena kematian tanggungan pribadi
Bukan milik siapapun untuk disudahi
Budaya, bahasa berputar abadi
Jangan coba atur tutur kata kami
Hidup tak sependek penis laki-laki
Jangan coba atur gaya berpakaian kami

Secukupnya Lyrics


Kapan terakhir kali kamu dapat tertidur tenang?
(Renggang)
Tak perlu memikirkan tentang apa yang akan datang
Di esok hari

Tubuh yang berpatah hati
Bergantung pada gaji
Berlomba jadi asri
Mengais validasi

Dan aku pun tak hadir
Seakan paling mahir
Menenangkan dirimu
Yang merasa terpinggirkan dunia
Tak pernah adil
Kita semua gagal
Angkat minumanmu
Bersedih bersama-sama

(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Sia-sia (Pada akhirnya)
Putus asa, (Terekam pedih semua)
Masalahnya, (Lebih dari yang)
Secukupnya


Rekam gambar dirimu yang terabadikan bertahun
Silam

Putra-putri sakit hati
Ayah-ibu sendiri
Komitmen lama mati
Hubungan yang menyepi

Wisata masa lalu
Kau hanya merindu
Mencari pelarian
Dari pengabdian yang terbakar sirna
(Mengapur berdebu)
Kita semua gagal
Ambil s'dikit tisu
Bersedihlah secukupnya

(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Secukupnya ('Kan masih ada)
Penggantinya (Belum waktunya kau bisa)
Menjawabnya (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Secukupnya


Semua yang sirna 'kan kembali lagi
Semua yang sirna 'kan nanti berganti

Rumah ke Rumah Lyrics

Menyesal, tak kusampaikan
Cinta monyetku
 ke Kanya dan Rebecca
Apa kabar kalian di sana?
Semoga hidup baik-baik saja
Tak belajar, terkena getahnya
Saat bersama Thanya dan Saphira
Kupercaya mungkin bukan jalannya
Namun kalian banyak salah juga
Jika dahulu ku tak cepat berubah
Ini maafku untukmu, Sharfina
Segala doa yang baik adanya
Untukmu dan mimpimu yang mulia

Pindah berkala, rumah ke rumah
Berharap bisa berujung indah
Walau akhirnya harus berpisah
T'rima kasih kar'na ku tak mudah
Pindah berkala, rumah ke rumah
Berharap bisa berujung indah
Walau akhirnya harus berpisah
T'rima kasih kar'na ku tak mudah

Maaf jika ku sering buat susah
Indisya, Panda, Anggra, Caca, Sismita
P'rempuan terkuat dalam hidupku
Terjanglah apa pun yang kalian tuju
Kau datang saat gelapku merekah
Seluruh hatiku untukmu, Meidiana
Kau pantas dapatkan yang baik di dunia
S'moga kita bertahan lama


Pindah berkala, rumah ke rumah
Mengambil pelajaran jika berpisah
Jikalau suatu saat berujung indah
Catat nama kita dalam sejarah
Pindah berkala, rumah ke rumah
Mengambil pelajaran jika berpisah
Jikalau suatu saat berujung indah
Catat nama kita dalam sejarah

Letih mengembara, rumah ke rumah
Kadang ku lupa akanmu, 
Amalia
Siap sedia tiap ku bercerita
Ku beruntung jadi anakmu, Bunda

Pindah berkala, rumah ke rumah
Selalu pada diri-Mu aku berserah
Jika ku disebut dalam sejarah
M'reka takkan lupa kar'na siapa

Tarot Lyrics

 

Nama yang sama bertahan
Dalam ruangan hening
Tanpa suara bertahan
Tak bergeming
 

Terlalu lama bercanda
Kita tak terbiasa
Dengan celaka yang nyata
Diam tak berdaya
 

Namun aku bingung kenapa ku tak pergi
Aku bingung kalian masih di sini
Apa mungkin karena terlalu lama?
Apa benar ‘tuk berbagi derita?
Mungkin nanti semua justru memburuk
Hati-hati, namun terjatuh lagi
Tapi luka adalah niscaya
Kutanggung denganmu selama ku mampu
Selama ku mampu

Di kehidupan kedua (Di kesempatan kedua)
S’moga kau tak terlalu keras kepala
Atau mungkin ini bukan yang pertama (Ini bukan yang pertama)
Dan kita diberi kesempatan berubah
Kuyakin nyawa kita bertautan
Khatam berbagai cobaan
Selalu menertawakan ramalan bintang, 
kartu tarot
Orang pintar pembaca nasib
 

Namun aku bingung kenapa ku tak pergi

Berita Kehilangan Lyrics

Badanku terkujur kaku, bentuk malang melintang
Tertutup mataku namun cahaya semakin terang
Jiwaku mengambang tinggi terus melayang-layang
Nyawaku dirampas namun kita yang jaya perang

Biarkan aku pergi dengan tenang
Bunda, kali ini saja jangan menangisi jasadku
Namaku abadi
Kebencian takkan pernah menang karena

Beberapa orang memaafkan
Beberapa yang lain yang membawa
Berita kehilangan melalui
Perbuatan, perkataan menyakitkan

Jika ini memang caranya
Menggenapkan namamu yang kuberikan
Sama seperti artinya
Saat kau berkorban, menyadarkan
Sayang, kau telah menjadi abadi
Di hati, di sejarah kami
Dan kurelakan hari ini, besok, lusa
Atau lain kali, karena

Takkan ada kedamaian di hidupmu
Takkan ada ketenteraman di kamarmu
Takkan ada keberlanjutan namamu
Takkan ada kedamaian di surgamu

Kami Belum Tentu Lyrics
Lirik ""Kami Belum Tentu""

Tiang masih berdiri
Bendera makin tinggi
Berkibar tiap pagi
Dimakan matahari
Merah makin memudar
Yang bunglon merasa benar
Putih makin menguning
Yang pintar masih berpaling
Ditinggal beasiswa
Tenang kawan, tak apa
Bertahan, buat apa?
Belum ada artinya
Masih dipeluk setan
Alergi peradaban
Alergi kemajuan
Mendorong kemunduran

Pemimpin di esok hari
(Adakah yang cukup mampu?)
Mewakilkan suara kami
(Jelas tak ada yang tahu!)
Ada yang cukup peduli
Umat yang dikelabui
Melupakan masa lalu
(Namun kami belum tentu!)


Earth-03 kerusuhan lagi
Earth-04 perang nuklir lagi
Jadikan pelajaran
Jangan sampai rusak beneran
Earth-02 masih main tusuk
Tiap hari kian buruk
Ayo cepat mending rujuk
Jangan sampai salah tunjuk

Apa guna gelar kami?
(Siapa yang sudah tahu?)
Jadi apa tua nanti?
(Tentu kami belum tahu!)
Tumblr, Reddit diblok lagi
(Siapa bilang situs biru?)
Untuk apa terkoneksi
(Jika masih mati lampu?)
Cukup dikasih hati
(Masih minta tambah paru)
Pura-pura bersih lagi
(Bagaikan Kalpataru)
Jelas-jelas tangan besi
(Masih berlagak rindu!)
Sembah Tuhan tiap minggu
(Tapi masih lempar batu)

Evaluasi Lyrics


Yang tak bisa terobati
Biarlah
Mengering sendiri
Menghias tubuh dan
Yang mengevaluasi
Ragamu
Hanya kau sendiri
Mereka tak mampu

Melewati yang telah kau lewati
Tiap berganti hari
Rintangan yang kau hadapi

Masalah yang mengeruh
Oh, perasaan yang rapuh
Ini belum separuhnya
Biasa saja
Kamu tak apa

Yang selalu ingin ambil peran
Hanya berlomba menjadi lebih
Sedih dari dirimu


Muak dikesampingkan
Disamakan
Hatimu terluka, sempurna

Masalah yang mengeruh
Oh, perasaan yang rapuh
Ini belum separuhnya
Biasa saja
Kamu tak apa
Perjalanan yang jauh
Kau bangun untuk bertaruh
Hari belum selesai
Biasa saja
Kamu tak apa

Bilas muka, gosok gigi, evaluasi
Tidur sejenak menemui esok pagi
Walau pedih ku bersamamu kali ini
Ku masih ingin melihatmu esok hari
Bilas muka, gosok gigi, evaluasi
Tidur sejenak menemui esok pagi
Walau pedih ku bersamamu kali ini

everything u are Lyrics


Wajahmu kuingat selalu
Lupakan hal-hal yang menggangguku
Karena hari ini mata kita beradu
Kita saling bantu melepas perasaan

Tinggi ke angkasa, menantang dunia
Merayakan muda ‘tuk satu jam saja
Kita hampir mati dan kau selamatkan aku
Dan ku menyelamatkanmu dan sekarang aku tahu

Cerita kita tak jauh berbeda
Got beat down by the world, sometimes I wanna fold
Namun suratmu kan kuceritakan ke anak-anakku nanti
Bahwa aku pernah dicintai with everything you are
Fully as I am with everything you are

Wajahmu yang beragam rupa
Pastikan ku tak sendirian
Jalani derita, kau bawakan kisahmu
Aku mendengarkan, oh kita bergantian


Bertukar nestapa, menawar trauma
Datang seadanya, terasku terbuka
Kita hampir mati dan kau sеlamatkan aku
Dan ku menyelamatkanmu dan sekarang aku tahu

Cеrita kita tak jauh berbeda
Got beat down by the world, sometimes I wanna fold
Namun suratmu kan kuceritakan ke anak-anakku nanti
Bahwa aku pernah dicintai

Seada-adanya, sekurang-kurangnya
Walau sulit utarakan hatiku dengan indah
Walau jarang ku bernyanyi dengan cara yang indah
Tapi tak sekali pun kisahku pernah kau bantah

Cerita kita tak jauh berbeda
Got beat down by the world (beat down by the world), sometimes I wanna fold
Namun suratmu kan kuceritakan ke anak-anakku nanti
Bahwa aku pernah dicintai with everything you are
Fully as I am with everything you are",https://genius.com/Hindia-everything-u-are-lyrics,"Wajahmu kuingat selalu

Karena hari ini mata kita beradu
Kita saling bantu melepas perasaan
Tinggi ke angkasa, menantang dunia
Merayakan muda ‘tuk satu jam saja
Kita hampir mati dan kau selamatkan aku
Dan ku menyelamatkanmu dan sekarang aku tahu
Cerita kita tak jauh berbeda
Namun suratmu kan kuceritakan ke anak-anakku nanti
Bahwa aku pernah dicintai with everything you are
Fully as I am with everything you are
Wajahmu yang beragam rupa
Pastikan ku tak sendirian
Jalani derita, kau bawakan kisahmu
Aku mendengarkan, oh kita bergantian
Bertukar nestapa, menawar trauma
Datang seadanya, terasku terbuka
Kita hampir mati dan kau sеlamatkan aku
Dan ku menyelamatkanmu dan sekarang aku tahu
Cеrita kita tak jauh berbeda
Namun suratmu kan kuceritakan ke anak-anakku nanti
Bahwa aku pernah dicintai
Seada-adanya, sekurang-kurangnya
Walau sulit utarakan hatiku dengan indah
Walau jarang ku bernyanyi dengan cara yang indah
Tapi tak sekali pun kisahku pernah kau bantah
Cerita kita tak jauh berbeda
Namun suratmu kan kuceritakan ke anak-anakku nanti
Bahwa aku pernah dicintai with everything you are
Fully as I am with everything you are","I always remember your face Forget the things that bother me Because today our eyes met We help each other release feelings High into the sky, challenging the world Celebrate youth for just one hour We almost died and you saved me And I saved you and now I know Our story is not much different But I will tell your letter to my children later That I was once loved with everything you are Fully as I am with everything you are Your various faces Make sure I'm not alone Live the suffering, you tell your story I'm listening, oh we take turns Exchanging sorrows, dealing with trauma Come as is, my terrace is open We almost died and you saved me And I saved you and now I know Our story is not much different But I will tell your letter to my children later That I was once loved As is, at least Even though it's difficult to express my heart beautifully Even though I rarely sing in a beautiful way But not once have you denied my story Our story is not much different But I will tell your letter to my children later That I was once loved with everything you are Fully as I am with everything you are"

Untuk Apa/Untuk Apa? Lyrics


And it wasn't social intelligence
It wasn't good looks, physical health
And it wasn't IQ
It was grit

Rumah ini dahulu sederhana
Ruang demi ruang dibangun bersama
Angan-angan yang dulu mimpi belaka
Kita gapai segala yang tak disangka
Tak sadar menimbun yang lebih berharga
Berdiri di atas yang lebih bermakna
Anak tangga yang berlebihan jumlahnya
Mendaki terus entah mau ke mana?

Dan kau selalu bertanya untuk apa?
Mengelak, kerap kutemukan jawabnya
Medusa dan semakin keras kepala
Seakan hidup hanya untuk bekerja
Mengejar mimpi sampai tak punya rasa
Mengejar mimpi sampai lupa k'luarga
Mengejar mimpi lupa dunia nyata
Mengejar mimpi tapi tidak bersama


Padahal katanya uang takkan ke mana
Jika memang rezeki, ya 'kan ditransfer juga
Namun dikejar terus seakan satwa langka
Di prosesnya melintah lupa jadi manusia
Melihat Hawa jadi panas lupa cuaca
Tertiup angin buah jatuh digigit juga
Seakan perlu banyak seperti Dewa Siwa
Padahal manusia hanya bertangan dua
Kasur yang luas tapi bangun sendiri
Mobil baru mengkilap tanpa penumpang di kiri
Banyak sepatu minim privasi susah pergi
PS4, Nintendo Switch tanpa player dua

Dan dahulu kau bertanya untuk apa?
Lalu kuperhatikan ini semua
Barang mahal yang tidak ada harganya
Dan sekarang ku bertanya untuk apa?

Terlepas apa yang engkau percayai
Tetap takkan ada yang dibawa mati
Kembali ke tanah dan tumbuh cemara
Mana saja harta yang lebih berharga
Terlepas apa yang engkau percayai
Tetap takkan ada yang dibawa mati
Kembali ke tanah dan tumbuh cemara
Mana saja harta yang lebih berharga
Terlepas apa yang engkau percayai
Tetap takkan ada yang dibawa mati
Menimbun surga yang tak bisa dibagi
Akhirnya pun wafat sendiri-sendiri


Mengangkat ikat rambutmu yang tertinggal
Di lengan kiri mobilku, terakhir kita menonton
Jariku tak juga kuat, sungguh janggal
Lebih berat dari seribu ton
Satu dari ribuan hal kecil
Yang sekarang menjadi terampil
Menggosok garam di atas luka
Dulu tak ada apa-apanya
Rute pagi yang dahulu ceria
Menu favorit kini hambar rasanya
Foto yang tak berani dilirik mata
Kontak sekarang jadi sebatas nama
Masing-masing selamat dan bercerita
Namun tidak lagi
Miliki bersama

Cepat namun sendiri, untuk apa?
Bersama tapi meracuni, untuk apa?
Cepat namun sendiri, untuk apa?
Bersama tapi meracuni, untuk apa?

And you always ask what for? Avoid it, I often find the answer Medusa and increasingly stubborn As if living only to work Chasing dreams until there is no feeling Chasing dreams until forgetting family Chasing dreams forgetting the real world Chasing dreams but not together Even though he said the money wasn't going anywhere If you have good fortune, it will be transferred too But he continues to be chased as if he were a rare animal In the process the leech forgets to be human Seeing Eve getting hot forgot the weather Blown by the wind, the fruit fell and was bitten too As if you need a lot like Lord Shiva Even though humans only have two hands Spacious mattress but build it yourself Shiny new car with no passengers on the left Many shoes with minimal privacy are difficult to leave PS4, Nintendo Switch without player two And first you asked what for? Then I looked at all of this Expensive items that have no price And now I ask what for? Regardless of what you believe Still no one will be taken to death Return to the ground and grow cypress Which treasure is more valuable? Regardless of what you believe Still no one will be taken to death Return to the ground and grow cypress Which treasure is more valuable? Regardless of what you believe Still no one will be taken to death Hoarding heaven that cannot be shared Finally, they died alone Pick up your loose hair tie On the left arm of my car, last we watched My fingers aren't strong either, which is really odd Heavier than a thousand tons One of thousands of little things Who has now become skilled Rub salt over the wound Previously there was nothing The once cheerful morning route Favorite menu now tastes bland Photos that don't dare to glance at them Contacts are now limited to names Each survived and told a story But not anymore Have it together Fast but alone, for what? Together but poisoned, for what? Fast but alone, for what? Together but poisoned, for what? Fast but alone, for what? Together but poisoned, for what?"

Kelelawar Lyrics


Unjuk rasa di alun-alun neraka
Mengguyur luka mayoritas dengan Vodka
Menantang maut, mengadu sikut
Membabi buta, bela logika
Menantang cakrawala

Tutup mata mengarungi lorong waktu
Jangan patah arang saat hasil belum menentu
Kejar jawaban dari 
Coki, Rey dan Vicky
Guna mencari

Siapa, mengapa
Di mana
, apa
Bagaimana

Banyak cara taklukkan malam
Banyak cara hancurkan sulam
Banyak cara kelinci dibalap kura-kura
Kelelawar, tak akan dibutakan surya

(Tak akan dibutakan surya)

Terjun bebas dari puncak Jayapura
Menendang bigot jatuh ke dasar samudera
Bermuka dua, lidah bercabang tiga
Raga terbelah

Lima lawan berenam
Tujuh, delapan
Maju semua

Banyak cara taklukkan malam
Banyak cara hancurkan sulam
Banyak cara kelinci dibalap kura-kura
Kelelawar, raja malam
[Bridge: Baskara & 
Karaeng
]
Tak akan dibutakan surya
Tak akan dibekukan duka
Kebal racun takkan tertawa
Takkan menghirup bunga gila
(Di dalamku multisemesta)
Kebal tirani rata-rata
(Urat nadiku seribu nyawa)
Tidak takut takhayul dewa
(Di dalamku multisemesta)
Kebal gertak masuk neraka
(Urat nadiku seribu nyawa)
Suci tanpa harus didoa

Tak akan dibekukan duka

It felt like days
We're still there
After countless times of circular reasoning
And tireless explanation of how all loving she is
Going through my ears
As the wind began to shout stronger
""don't disrupt the balance
Forget the past, move on
And I promise you to be loving""
She tried to make a pact with me
But I can't
I can't forget the past
When I remember my friends practicing bigotry
When I remember my family shutting me down
For my religious opinion
When I remember Moslem friends telling me
That I deserve hell as a Christian
When I remember Christian friends telling me
That I deserve hell as an atheist
When I remember authorities telling me
That I deserve jail for being myself

Saat engkau tertidur
Aku pergi menghibur
Beda kota pisah raga bukan masalahku
Lihat wajahmu di layar ku tetap bersyukur

Saat engkau terjaga
Aku kan ada di sana
Sempatkan bermain dan bawakan cenderamata
Satu sampai lima tahun cepat tak terasa

Segala hal kuupayakan untuk
Melindungi
Tunggu aku kembali lagi esok
Pagi

Tumbuh lebih baik, cari panggilanmu
Jadi lebih baik dibanding diriku
‘Tuk sementara ini aku
Mengembara
Jauh, saat dewasa kau kan mengerti


Saat engkau dewasa
Dan aku kian menua
Jika ku berpulang lebih awal, tidak apa
Berjumpa lagi di sana
, aku tetap sama

Saat engkau teringat
Tengkar kita, manakala
Maaf atas perjalanan yang tidak sempurna
Namun percayalah untukmu kujual dunia

Segala hal kuupayakan untuk
Mеlindungi (Untuk melindungi)
Tunggu aku kembali lagi esok
Pagi (Sеlalu janjiku pada dirimu)

Tumbuh lebih baik, cari panggilanmu
Jadi lebih baik dibanding diriku
Dan tertawalah saat ini
Selepas-lepasnya
Karena kelak kau kan tersakiti

Aku tahu kamu hebat namun selamanya diriku pasti berkutat
‘Tuk selalu jauhkanmu dari dunia yang jahat
Ini sumpahku padamu ‘tuk biarkanmu


Tumbuh lebih baik, cari panggilanmu
Jadi lebih baik dibanding diriku

Membasuh Lyrics


Selama ini
Kunanti
Yang kuberikan datang berbalik
Tak kunjung pulang
Apa pun yang terbilang

Telat kusadar hidup bukanlah
Perihal mengambil yang kau tebar
Sedikit air yang kupunya
Milikmu juga bersama

Bisakah kita tetap memberi
Walau tak suci?
Bisakah terus mengobati
Walau membiru?
Cukup besar 'tuk mengampuni
'Tuk mengasihi
Tanpa memperhitungkan masa yang lalu
Walau kering
Bisakah kita tetap membasuh?



Kita bergerak dan bersuara
Berjalan jauh

Tarian Penghancur Raya Lyrics
Lirik ""Tarian Penghancur Raya""

Mata dan peluh yang asin
Perlahan dihapus angin
Jogja yang beku mendingin
Menari, menghancurkan alam raya
Yang kecewa
Dibuatnya malapetaka

Kamar berjeruji berpenghuni bersafari
Berbagai fauna flora kerasukan freon di ruko toko bunga
Bank ahli industri teknologi etnografi
Produksi menggurui penghuni asli

Berbicara cepat bilang haram
Kearifan lokal yang dibungkam
Tuli pada yang belajar alam
Mati sesak nafas tengah malam

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la

Trotoar lebar
, bahan hijau, 
Tesla
Kalah cepat disalip Kuda Asia
Tewas di lampu merah garis zebra
Efek Rumah Kaca tiba-tiba suddenly di mana-mana

Uap terlontar mengepung kota
Berlomba ciptakan plastik kita
Saat senja kehabisan kata
Siang malam pun gelap gulita

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la

Kerja bakti menyusun neraka
Kita miliki bahan bakarnya
Perihal waktu tunggu datangnya
O2 dijual oleh negara
Oh terima kasih 'kan usahanya
Sedotan besi, plastik cycle tiga
Pun pepohonan tak berkuasa
Lawan kebijakan yang bertamasya
Burung bersiul malapetaka
Gurun menatap dingin manusia
Laut dan pegunungan kecewa
Kudeta besar alam semesta
Siarkan kabar penelan surya
Meleleh matikan Kutub Utara
Amalkan tarian penghancur raya
Kobarkan tarian penghancur raya
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la

Arteri Lyrics

 

Telanjang, ku telanjang menyicipi dunia
Hatiku berkata
“Selamat datang di dua puluh!”
Kau tambal kegagalanku
Kau masuk ke dalam darah, berdansa dan berserah
Untuk sekian jam saja
 

Sembunyikanmu dari dunia, hilang akal saat kau ada
Berputar, mana ujungnya?
 

Menangisku di pundakmu
Kau bilang muntahkan semua pilu
Aku pura-pura tak tahu, aku pura-pura tak sadar
Kau hanya trauma (Meluncur di Arteri)
 

Aku ingin tak menghiraukan masa depan
Namun hidup apa hanya delapan kali sebulan?
Salahku memikirkan untuk menyelamatkan
Saat kaulah titik perkara
 

Menangisku di pundakmu
Kau bilang muntahkan semua pilu
Aku pura-pura tak tahu, aku pura-pura tak sadar
Kau hanya trauma (Di Arteri Pondok Indah)
 

Aku berlari, lari, lari
Lari mengejar dirimu
Cinta macam apa
Yang dijaga ketat oleh perantara?
Indraku mati rasa
Kubuang jauh dalam
Tempat sampah (Di Arteri Pondok Indah)
 

 

Kau hanya trauma
Meluncur di Arteri
Hanya lagu lama
Bernyanyi di Arteri
 

Menangisku di pundakmu
Kau bilang muntahkan semua pilu
Aku pura-pura tak tahu, aku pura-pura tak sadar
Kau hanya trauma (Meluncur di arteri)
 

Setetes bahagia yang selalu kau cari
Mengalir berkelana meluncur di arteri

Dalam Hitungan Lyrics
Lirik ""Dalam Hitungan""

Dear Twitter, please do your magic
Semoga rohku selalu kekal dalam hitungan
Tidak diretas oleh umat luar jaringan

Aku tak berguna jika tak diukur angka
Bertobat di media, Tuhan pasti salah sangka
Mimpi butuh dana, ""Engagement rate-mu berapa?
""
Terka jarak berita, tragedi milik siapa?
Memahat citra sesuai standar-Nya
Surga buka cabang, kita semua pialang
Seratus ribu per sepuluh Giga
Akhirat yang adil, semua orang berwenang

Sekarang semua
Tidur tenang
Cek lagi besok pagi
Keselamatan

Kita membangun bersama
Tuhan yang baru
Dunia yang berani
Semua orang berseru
Taman Eden dengan wi-fi dan kamera depan
Malaikat yang hadir mengukur dalam hitungan


Kehidupan dibenahi arahan redaksi
Kematian disiarkan Instagram TV
Nyanyian pujian yang termatrikulasi
Sangkakala seindah bunyi notifikasi

Kita membangun bersama
Tuhan yang baru
Dunia yang berani
Semua orang berseru
Taman Eden dengan wi-fi dan kamera depan
Malaikat yang hadir mengukur dalam hitungan
Membangun bersama
Tuhan yang baru
Dunia yang berani
Semua orang berseru
Taman Eden dengan wi-fi dan kamera depan
Malaikat yang hadir mengukur dalam hitungan

Peradaban Lyrics


Bawa pesan ini ke persekutuanmu
Tempat ibadah terbakar lagi
Bawa pesan ini lari ke keluargamu
Nama kita diinjak lagi
Bagai keset ""Selamat Datang""
Masuk kencang tanpa diundang
Ambil minum lepas dahaga
Rampas galon, dispenser pula
Yang jadi saksi harus kuat
Tak terbutakan dunia/akhirat
Yang patah tumbuh, yang hilang berganti
Gapura hancur dibangun lagi

Karena peradaban takkan pernah mati
Walau diledakkan, diancam 'tuk diobati
Karena peradaban berputar abadi
Kebal luka bakar, tusuk, atau caci maki
Karena peradaban takkan pernah mati
Walau diledakkan, diancam 'tuk diobati
Karena peradaban berputar abadi
Kebal luka bakar, tusuk, atau caci maki


Beberapa orang menghakimi lagi
Walaupun diludahi zaman 1000 kali
Beberapa orang memaafkan lagi
Walau sudah ditindas habis berkali-kali

Karena peradaban takkan pernah mati
Walau diledakkan, diancam 'tuk diobati
Karena peradaban berputar abadi
Kebal luka bakar, tusuk, atau caci maki
Karena peradaban takkan pernah mati
Walau diledakkan, diancam 'tuk diobati
Karena peradaban berputar abadi
Kebal luka bakar, tusuk, atau caci maki

Karena kehidupan tidak ternodai
Maknanya jika kau tak sepaham dengan kami
Karena kematian tanggungan pribadi
Bukan milik siapapun untuk disudahi
Budaya, bahasa berputar abadi
Jangan coba atur tutur kata kami
Hidup tak sependek penis laki-laki
Jangan coba atur gaya berpakaian kami


Suatu saat nanti tanah air kembali berdiri
Suatu saat nanti kita memimpin diri sendiri
Suatu saat nanti kita meninggalkan sidik jari
Suatu saat nanti semoga semua berbesar hati
Suatu saat nanti tanah air kembali berdiri
Suatu saat nanti kita memimpin diri sendiri
Suatu saat nanti kita meninggalkan sidik jari
Suatu saat nanti semoga semua berbesar hati

Suatu saat nanti tanah air kembali berdiri

Tarot Lyrics

 

Nama yang sama bertahan
Dalam ruangan hening
Tanpa suara bertahan
Tak bergeming
 

Terlalu lama bercanda
Kita tak terbiasa
Dengan celaka yang nyata
Diam tak berdaya
 

Namun aku bingung kenapa ku tak pergi
Aku bingung kalian masih di sini
Apa mungkin karena terlalu lama?
Apa benar ‘tuk berbagi derita?
Mungkin nanti semua justru memburuk
Hati-hati, namun terjatuh lagi
Tapi luka adalah niscaya
Kutanggung denganmu selama ku mampu
Selama ku mampu

Di kehidupan kedua (Di kesempatan kedua)
S’moga kau tak terlalu keras kepala
Atau mungkin ini bukan yang pertama (Ini bukan yang pertama)
Dan kita diberi kesempatan berubah
Kuyakin nyawa kita bertautan
Khatam berbagai cobaan
Selalu menertawakan ramalan bintang, 
kartu tarot
Orang pintar pembaca nasib

Berita Kehilangan Lyrics

Badanku terkujur kaku, bentuk malang melintang
Tertutup mataku namun cahaya semakin terang
Jiwaku mengambang tinggi terus melayang-layang
Nyawaku dirampas namun kita yang jaya perang

Biarkan aku pergi dengan tenang

Beberapa yang lain yang membawa
Berita kehilangan melalui
Perbuatan, perkataan menyakitkan

Menggenapkan namamu yang kuberikan
Sama seperti artinya

Kami Belum Tentu Lyrics
Lirik ""Kami Belum Tentu""

Tiang masih berdiri
Bendera makin tinggi
Berkibar tiap pagi
Dimakan matahari
Merah makin memudar
Yang bunglon merasa benar
Putih makin menguning
Yang pintar masih berpaling
Ditinggal beasiswa
Tenang kawan, tak apa
Bertahan, buat apa?
Belum ada artinya
Masih dipeluk setan
Alergi peradaban
Alergi kemajuan
Mendorong kemunduran

Pemimpin di esok hari
(Adakah yang cukup mampu?)
Mewakilkan suara kami
(Jelas tak ada yang tahu!)
Ada yang cukup peduli
Umat yang dikelabui
Melupakan masa lalu
(Namun kami belum tentu!)


Earth-03 kerusuhan lagi
Earth-04 perang nuklir lagi
Jadikan pelajaran
Jangan sampai rusak beneran
Earth-02 masih main tusuk
Tiap hari kian buruk
Ayo cepat mending rujuk
Jangan sampai salah tunjuk

Pemimpin di esok hari
(Adakah yang cukup mampu?)
Mewakilkan suara kami

Apa guna gelar kami?
(Siapa yang sudah tahu?)
Jadi apa tua nanti?
(Tentu kami belum tahu!)
Tumblr, Reddit diblok lagi
(Siapa bilang situs biru?)
Untuk apa terkoneksi
(Jika masih mati lampu?)
Cukup dikasih hati
(Masih minta tambah paru)
Pura-pura bersih lagi
(Bagaikan Kalpataru)
Jelas-jelas tangan besi
(Masih berlagak rindu!)
Sembah Tuhan tiap minggu
(Tapi masih lempar batu)

Ada yang cukup peduli

Melupakan masa lalu

Jangan sampai salah tunjuk

Untuk apa terkoneksi
(Jika masih mati lampu?)
Cukup dikasih hati
(Masih minta tambah paru)
Pura-pura bersih lagi
(Bagaikan Kalpataru)
Jelas-jelas tangan besi

Sembah Tuhan tiap minggu

Kelelawar Lyrics


Unjuk rasa di alun-alun neraka
Mengguyur luka mayoritas dengan Vodka
Menantang maut, mengadu sikut
Membabi buta, bela logika
Menantang cakrawala

Tutup mata mengarungi lorong waktu
Jangan patah arang saat hasil belum menentu
Kejar jawaban dari 
Coki, Rey dan Vicky
Guna mencari

Siapa, mengapa
Di mana
, apa
Bagaimana

Banyak cara taklukkan malam
Banyak cara hancurkan sulam
Banyak cara kelinci dibalap kura-kura
Kelelawar, tak akan dibutakan surya

(Tak akan dibutakan surya)

Terjun bebas dari puncak Jayapura
Menendang bigot jatuh ke dasar samudera
Bermuka dua, lidah bercabang tiga
Raga terbelah

Lima lawan berenam
Tujuh, delapan
Maju semua

Banyak cara taklukkan malam
Banyak cara hancurkan sulam
Banyak cara kelinci dibalap kura-kura
Kelelawar, raja malam
[Bridge: Baskara & 
Karaeng
]
Tak akan dibutakan surya
Tak akan dibekukan duka
Kebal racun takkan tertawa
Takkan menghirup bunga gila
(Di dalamku multisemesta)
Kebal tirani rata-rata
(Urat nadiku seribu nyawa)
Tidak takut takhayul dewa
(Di dalamku multisemesta)
Kebal gertak masuk neraka
(Urat nadiku seribu nyawa)
Suci tanpa harus didoa
(Di dalamku multisemesta)
Kebal tirani rata-rata
(Urat nadiku seribu nyawa)
Tidak takut takhayul dewa
(Di dalamku multisemesta)
Kebal gertak masuk neraka
(Urat nadiku seribu nyawa)
Suci tanpa harus di doa

[Outro: 
Karaeng
 & Baskara]
(Di dalamku multisemesta)
(Urat nadiku seribu nyawa)
Tak akan dibutakan surya

Tak akan dibekukan duka
(Di dalamku multisemesta)
(Urat nadiku seribu nyawa)
Tak akan dibutakan surya
(Di dalamku multisemesta)
(Urat nadiku seribu nyawa)
Tak akan dibekukan duka

It felt like days
We're still there
After countless times of circular reasoning
And tireless explanation of how all loving she is
Going through my ears
As the wind began to shout stronger
""don't disrupt the balance
Forget the past, move on
And I promise you to be loving""
She tried to make a pact with me
But I can't
I can't forget the past
When I remember my friends practicing bigotry
When I remember my family shutting me down
For my religious opinion
When I remember Moslem friends telling me
That I deserve hell as a Christian
When I remember Christian friends telling me
That I deserve hell as an atheist
When I remember authorities telling me
That I deserve jail for being myself

Saat engkau tertidur
Aku pergi menghibur
Beda kota pisah raga bukan masalahku
Lihat wajahmu di layar ku tetap bersyukur

Saat engkau terjaga
Aku kan ada di sana
Sempatkan bermain dan bawakan cenderamata
Satu sampai lima tahun cepat tak terasa

Segala hal kuupayakan untuk
Melindungi
Tunggu aku kembali lagi esok
Pagi

Tumbuh lebih baik, cari panggilanmu
Jadi lebih baik dibanding diriku
‘Tuk sementara ini aku
Mengembara
Jauh, saat dewasa kau kan mengerti


Saat engkau dewasa
Dan aku kian menua
Jika ku berpulang lebih awal, tidak apa
Berjumpa lagi di sana
, aku tetap sama

Saat engkau teringat
Tengkar kita, manakala
Maaf atas perjalanan yang tidak sempurna
Namun percayalah untukmu kujual dunia

Segala hal kuupayakan untuk
Mеlindungi (Untuk melindungi)
Tunggu aku kembali lagi esok
Pagi (Sеlalu janjiku pada dirimu)

Tumbuh lebih baik, cari panggilanmu
Jadi lebih baik dibanding diriku
Dan tertawalah saat ini
Selepas-lepasnya
Karena kelak kau kan tersakiti

Aku tahu kamu hebat namun selamanya diriku pasti berkutat
‘Tuk selalu jauhkanmu dari dunia yang jahat
Ini sumpahku padamu ‘tuk biarkanmu


Tumbuh lebih baik, cari panggilanmu
Jadi lebih baik dibanding diriku

Tarian Penghancur Raya Lyrics
Lirik ""Tarian Penghancur Raya""

Mata dan peluh yang asin
Perlahan dihapus angin
Jogja yang beku mendingin
Menari, menghancurkan alam raya
Yang kecewa
Dibuatnya malapetaka

Kamar berjeruji berpenghuni bersafari
Berbagai fauna flora kerasukan freon di ruko toko bunga
Bank ahli industri teknologi etnografi
Produksi menggurui penghuni asli

Berbicara cepat bilang haram
Kearifan lokal yang dibungkam
Tuli pada yang belajar alam
Mati sesak nafas tengah malam

Tesla
Kalah cepat disalip Kuda Asia
Tewas di lampu merah garis zebra
Efek Rumah Kaca tiba-tiba suddenly di mana-mana

Uap terlontar mengepung kota
Berlomba ciptakan plastik kita
Saat senja kehabisan kata
Siang malam pun gelap gulita

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la

Kerja bakti menyusun neraka
Kita miliki bahan bakarnya
Perihal waktu tunggu datangnya
O2 dijual oleh negara
Oh terima kasih 'kan usahanya
Sedotan besi, plastik cycle tiga
Pun pepohonan tak berkuasa
Lawan kebijakan yang bertamasya
Burung bersiul malapetaka
Gurun menatap dingin manusia
Laut dan pegunungan kecewa
Kudeta besar alam semesta
Siarkan kabar penelan surya
Meleleh matikan Kutub Utara
Amalkan tarian penghancur raya
Kobarkan tarian penghancur raya
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la

Arteri Lyrics

 

Telanjang, ku telanjang menyicipi dunia
Hatiku berkata
“Selamat datang di dua puluh!”
Kau tambal kegagalanku
Kau masuk ke dalam darah, berdansa dan berserah
Untuk sekian jam saja
 

Sembunyikanmu dari dunia, hilang akal saat kau ada
Berputar, mana ujungnya?
 

Menangisku di pundakmu
Kau bilang muntahkan semua pilu
Aku pura-pura tak tahu, aku pura-pura tak sadar
Kau hanya trauma (Meluncur di Arteri)
 

Aku ingin tak menghiraukan masa depan
Namun hidup apa hanya delapan kali sebulan?
Salahku memikirkan untuk menyelamatkan
Saat kaulah titik perkara
 

Menangisku di pundakmu
Kau bilang muntahkan semua pilu
Aku pura-pura tak tahu, aku pura-pura tak sadar
Kau hanya trauma (Di Arteri Pondok Indah)
 

Aku berlari, lari, lari
Lari mengejar dirimu
Cinta macam apa
Yang dijaga ketat oleh perantara?
Indraku mati rasa
Kubuang jauh dalam
Tempat sampah (Di Arteri Pondok Indah)
 

 

Kau hanya trauma
Meluncur di Arteri
Hanya lagu lama
Bernyanyi di Arteri
 

Menangisku di pundakmu
Kau bilang muntahkan semua pilu
Aku pura-pura tak tahu, aku pura-pura tak sadar
Kau hanya trauma (Meluncur di arteri)

Lirik ""Dalam Hitungan""

Dear Twitter, please do your magic
Semoga rohku selalu kekal dalam hitungan
Tidak diretas oleh umat luar jaringan

Aku tak berguna jika tak diukur angka
Bertobat di media, Tuhan pasti salah sangka

Tidur tenang
Cek lagi besok pagi
Keselamatan

Kita membangun bersama

Dunia yang berani
Semua orang berseru

o,Tuan Lyrics

 

Oh jelas aku tahu, 
bunga akan layu
Rumput kian mengering,
 daun kan menguning
Kau tahu menurutku waktu adalah
Kutukan, ancaman, bualan
 

Dan satu per satu orang sekitarku
Mulai ditinggalkan, oh ini peringatan
 

Untukku, 
o Tuan
, wahai Kematian
Ku tak bisa melawan jamah perhentian
Berjanji kuikhlaskan dengan rela
Namun jangan hari ini
 

Melihatmu masuk ke dalam ruang operasi
Berdoa semalam suntuk di kamar yang hening
Tanpa metafora dan analogi
Kiasan berbelit diksi, tanpa berbungkus fiksi
Aku takut
 

Untuknya, o Tuan, wahai Kematian
Ku tak bisa melawan jamah perhentian
Berjanji kuikhlaskan dengan rela
Namun jangan hari ini
 

 

Kurelakan, o Tuan
Kurelakan, namun jangan hari ini
Kurelakan, o Tuan
Kurelakan, namun jangan hari ini
Kurelakan, o Tuan
Kurelakan, namun jangan hari ini
Namun jangan hari ini

Sectumsempra Lyrics


Kau bedah ilmu hitam tak tertandingi
Kau tindak, kau tindas yang sayap kiri
Lidahmu setajam yang 
darah murni
Tak perlu kawan, kau jalani sendiri

Lawanmu pasti kau tebas mati
Dengan sihirmu
Sihirmu
Sihirmu..
Sectumsempra!

Kau sangga kehormatan hijau dan perak
Menjaga derik ular tanpa merusak
Tangismu tertahan dan tak mendobrak
Walau tak murni, kau b'rani berteriak

Lawanmu pasti kau tebas mati
Dengan sihirmu
Sihirmu
Sihirmu..
Sectumsempra!



Lawanmu pasti kau tebas mati
Dengan sihirmu
Sihirmu
Sihirmu..
Sectumsempra!

Raaaahhh...!!
Akan ku bagi semesta menjadi ingatan-ingatan
Yang nanti semua makhluk bisa membesuk

Waktu ada di kolong tempat tidurmu
Tapi rumahmu adalah hutan

Minggir! Lyrics
Lirik ""Minggir!""

Hidup dalam layar
Berharap menjadi besar
Melalui jumlah pemirsa yang engkau tawar
Hidup di balik kaca
Berharap menjadi Akbar
Menabuh konflik menebar dusta di udara
Menembakkan garam ke angkasa
Hujan memperkeruh suasana
Mengkomodifikasi cuaca
Memperkosa etika

Minggir, minggir
(Pendapatmu tak relevan)
Minggir, minggir
(Perkataanmu tak sepadan)
Dengan tingkah laku nyatanya
Membela diri seadanya
Ulah tak sebesar namanya
Pengecut, minggir

Hidup dalam ilusi
Jaga ereksi abadi
Atas fantasi mulukmu 'tuk diri sendiri
Hidup dalam e Lucy
In the Sky above you float so free
The youth will burst you off your bubble in the count of three


Minggir, minggir
(Pendapatmu tak relevan)
Minggir, minggir
(Perkataanmu tak sepadan)
Dengan tingkah laku nyatanya
Membela diri seadanya
Ulah tak sebesar namanya
Pengecut, minggir

Manuver melupa batas
Bagaikan Jalur Gaza, Israel, Palestina
Meledak lagi, drone berterbangan
Massa kau bakar lagi, 
seseorang gantung diri
Di Cijantung
 tetap kau tunggangi

Watcher of the Wall Lyrics

Malam dan siang yang tidak pernah bertatap muka
Sebab diantara nya kemilau jingga masuk mengukir nama
Akan jurang yang membedakan diri mereka masing-masing

The night is holding down the sun
It's darkest before dawn
I set my eyes on this wall that
Separates us all
Ooh-oh-oh
This time now I know-how
Ooh-oh-oh
We're not the same after all
Ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

When Friday calls all gather round
And mocking can be found
No responds made on Sunday
Yet you here always wail
Ooh, I recognize this wall
Hmm, hat separates us all

Ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Dey bin hyah, dey bin hyah
My medah's bin birthin ever since uh child an o a na-na
Help dem Lord, help dem Lord
Me voices was heard in the heat tso tse day and isy cool o de nah
Kumbaya, Lord, Kumbaya, Kumbaya, Lord
Oh our Lord is never he, it, or she
Our Lord is never as well as Fa'afafine
Shut down, shut down, shut down
Hallelujah from the poplar tree
Oh yes, we are different an' all ben Papua been bloodin' thousands of death toll
If we crash, the military will have all the money
If we peace, they gwyne lost their investments and their honey
But if they force to own the sole all  money
We will shed in forever constant irony
Save me, shoot me
Save me, rape me
Lord, if my tongue split to three, then I'll strike up upon thee
But somehow upon all of my puffed-up-ness
We sank down deep in this river full of Victorian dress

Break it down, Lord! Break it down!
If I had a hammer this holy then I'll hit it every day
If I had a phone this loud I'll ring it everyday
Don't, no more 
Captain Ahab
This is a wreck ship and we've been sailing from the massive crack in Africa
What if I named the whale ""Milk""
It would've bring us calamities that are wrapped in silk
Oh God, in the name of Bhinneka
We're expecting you, Lord of the Saints
I gaze up to those flyin' crane
They flew into volcanic plume
That went to meet their hurtful doom
Willingly
Peacefully
I am the watcher of the wall
I am the watcher
I am the hot iron ball
Peace be upon y'all, fuckers
Shalom
Ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh


Tapi
 kata rendra
Tanpa oposisi mereka akan sepi dan onani
Apakah malam bisa gelap?
Jika matahari tidak berperan di tempat lain
Mana indah bianglala tunggal warna
Bagaimana kelahiran tanpa pelukan Yoni kepada Lingga
Bahasa di tiap lidah, selera di tiap tafsir, Aamiin di tiap iman, Batas di tiap identitas
Karna tanpa oposisi rezim terus berkuasa, Tanpa oposisi persepsi memakan kepala sendiri",https://genius.com/Feast-watcher-of-the-wall-lyrics,"Malam dan siang yang tidak pernah bertatap muka

Metakritik Lyrics

 

Malam kesekian memperdebatkan
Tutur perkataan dan gaya penulisan
Ada ketakutan dicaci karena
Punya kesalahan dan gaya berpakaian
 

Waswas cemas lihat yang lain, habis dilibas, aku membatin
Apakah ku terlalu peduli dengan standarmu yang beku dan sangat tinggi?
Bertanya-tanya apa kau benar-benar nilai dirimu dengan cara yang sama?
Atau apa aku takut dengan aibku dan lingkunganku?
 

Hidup di masa kecemasan, kita tumbang bergantian
Penantian menyiksa, terpaksa kubungkam diriku
Kali ini, harus main aman
Meninggalkan yang kubicarakan
Kehilangan jati diriku
 

Malam kesekian mempertanyakan
Semua keputusan yang telah diamalkan
Ada ketakutan sewaktu tiba
Sebuah penyesalan yang harus dijalankan
 

Waswas cеmas lihat diriku, mulai kesulitan dalam menulis
Apakah ku terlalu nyaman dеngan hidupku yang kini kian meninggi?
Bertanya-tanya apa ku benar-benar hilang amarah karena mulai menua?
Atau apa aku takut dengan aibku dan lingkunganku?
 

Hidup di masa kecemasan kita tumbang bergantian
Penantian menyiksa, terpaksa kubungkam diriku
Kali ini, harus main aman
Meninggalkan yang kubicarakan

Jerusalem Lyrics

Oh I thought it was over
With all these broken spines
We argue we fight
Talks were cold, extra shiver
30 days were all night
No sunshine no sight

Old school
Taxi and Uber we fight?
Why can't our road be as one?

Tear down this border
We share the same mother
Our foes aligned
Dreams intertwined
Blow off your steam
Tomorrow is fine

Share our promised land this time
Jerusalem's not just mine

Oh I got dreams without fever
Of a place I could call home
A place I share with some
Leave behind all this sickness and bruises
That you inflict upon me
That I inflict upon you


Fender and Gibson
Why do we fight?
Why can not we both rhyme as one?

Tear down this border
We share the same mother
Our foes aligned
Dreams intertwined
Blow off your steam
Tomorrow is fine

Share our promised land this time
Jerusalem's not just mine

I spoke a lot
Don't think know it was necessary
She shook her head
Let out a sigh
Suddenly the ground was shaking
Eyes blinded by light
Back in a cafe in Jakarta
I looked around and she wasn't there
Amazed
Such magic
Applause
Curtain call
But wait
Whom did I talk to?
Then again I was in a cafe in Jakarta
The music was loud
They were playing Kendrick
Doesn't fit the place's branding
But well, whatever
It was good
I should shut up and enjoy my latte
So either way it doesn't matter
If I spoke with myself
If I spoke with society
Or if
God spoke to me last night",https://genius.com/Feast-jerusalem-lyrics,"Oh I thought it was over

Menunggu hujan reda","There is always someone singing and making elegies Behind the black clouds Hopefully someone will shine a light on this dark side Waiting like a loyal rainbow Waiting for the rain to stop I always like it after Rain in December In December There is always someone singing and making elegies Behind the black clouds Hopefully someone will shine a light on this dark side Waiting like a loyal rainbow Waiting for the rain to stop I always like it after Rain in December In December Until later when the rain no longer drips Grief cuts through wounds until it rains Recovering wounds I always like it after Rain in December In December Because I always like it after Rain in December In December Like a rainbow, loyal Waiting for the rain to stop"

Seperti Rahim Ibu Lyrics

Dengarlah nyanyi sunyiku
Bait risauku
Rindu terpendamku
Menyala dalam hayatku
Duka padamu
Luka padaku
Saling lebur
Menghalau awan mendung

Kemanusiaan itu
Seperti terang pagi

Merekahkan harapan
Menepis kabut kelam

Niatkan, tinju terkepal
Pekik menebal
Terjang aral
Pagi pasti terkejar

Seandainya negeriku
Serupa rahim ibu


Merawat kehidupan
Menguatkan yang rapuh


Seandainya negeriku
Serupa rahim ibu

Merawat kehidupan
Menguatkan yang rapuh
Merawat kehidupan
Menguatkan yang rapuh

Menjadi terang pagi

Segala apa yang dirasakan
Tentang kebahagiaan
Air mata bercucuran
Hingga kan datang ketakutan
Menjaga keterusterangan
Dalam lapar dan kenyang
Dalam gelap dan benderang


Tentang akal dan hati
Rahasianya yang penuh teka-teki
Tentang nalar dan iman

Kami mau yang lebih indah, bukan hanya remah-remah sepah

Kami hanya akan mencipta segala apa yang kami cinta

Dihisap pikiranku, memori terhapus
Terkunci mulutku, menjeritkan pahit

Aku akan menjadi kanker dalam tubuh mereka

Sampai kapan kau biarkan dia tak berperan
Ditelantarkan harapan, dia kesakitan
Terburai berantakan, tak keruan
Marah di mana-mana

Sampai kapan kau ikhlaskan dia dihancurkan
Lumpuhkan alam pikiran dan sekujur badan
Terhampar masa depan, temaram
Lara di mana-mana

Keajaiban dan khayalan
Taruh di awan
Kenyataan dalam pelukan
Kelembaman pada tekanan
Raih elan, kepalkan tangan

Tak bisa langsung sehat, dihadapi dikelahi

Melankolia Lyrics


Tersungkur di sisa malam
Kosong dan rendah gairah
Puisi yang romantik
Menetes dari bibir

Murung itu sungguh indah
Melambatkan butir darah

Nikmatilah saja kegundahan ini
Segala denyutnya yang merobek sepi
Kelesuan ini jangan lekas pergi
Aku menyelami sampai lelah hati

Jatuh Cinta Itu Biasa Saja Lyrics


Kita berdua hanya berpegangan tangan
Tak perlu berpelukan
Kita berdua hanya saling bercerita
Tak perlu memuji

Kita berdua tak pernah ucapkan maaf
Tapi saling mengerti
Kita berdua tak hanya menjalani cinta
Tapi menghidupi

Ketika rindu menggebu-gebu
Kita menunggu
Jatuh cinta itu biasa saja

Kita berdua tak pernah ucapkan maaf
Tapi saling mengerti

Ketika rindu menggebu-gebu
Kita menunggu
Jatuh cinta itu biasa saja
Saat cemburu kian membelenggu
Cepat berlalu
Jatuh cinta itu biasa saja
Jatuh cinta itu biasa saja


Jika jatuh cinta itu buta
Berdua kita akan tersesat
Saling mencari di dalam gelap
Kedua mata kita gelap, lalu hati kita gelap
Hati kita gelap, lalu hati kita gelap

Kuning Lyrics



Tentang nubuat mencerahkan
Berlabuh dalam keheningan
Menyapa dalam keramaian
Pada batas yang dirasakan
Resah

Bernaung di dalam pikiran
Mencari setiap jejak-Nya
Mengulas semua kehendak-Nya

Apa wujudnya?
Ah ah ah
Apa misinya?
Ah ah ah

Manusia menafikan Tuhan
Melarang atas perbedaan
Persepsi dibelenggu tradisi
Jiwa yang keruh pun bersemi

Hari demi hari menanti
Tekad kami segunung tinggi

Nyali berlapis
Yang ditinggal takkan pernah diam
Mempertanyakan kapan pulang?

Teringat seru suaramu menepis keraguan
Namun dewasa mengubah
Cara pandang dan keikhlasan bersaut dan bergulat
Terperai-perai menghilang

Perih yang terasa, sakit yang tak sirna
Harapan akankah ada?
Berputar arah

Angan tenggelam dalam kabut dan amarah
Luka terkuak dan menggebu tanpa arah
Tangis yang terbendung
Terbuang dalam waktu yang meluruh

Harapan akankah ada?
Berubah

Sampaikan mereka bara dan suara

Berlalu, lalu kini kau menunggu
Serap seram di pundakmu
Lambat laun kan menari, kan berlari

Memori yang dulu kau hapuskan akan berlari
Saranku kau berhenti menyiksa diri
Waktu yang akan mengobatimu
Yang kau perlu kau mendewasakan itu

Sampaikan mereka bara dan suara
Sampaikan mereka bara dan suara

Lepaskan rantai yang membelenggu
Nyalakan api dan lenteramu
Lepaskan rantai yang membelenggu

Karolina Lyrics

Making love to you is like a dream to me
Having you inside me is a fantasy

I've been reaching for the stars
Trying to catch that morning sun
I long for you, my lady in the night

Sight by sight I see you
Walk into my eyes
Will I ever be
Beside you please, my love

Stormy wind blows with the night
Hope I'll never lose the sight
I love you, my lady in the night

I'll lead you to my life
Through the finest hour of my life (through the finest hour of my life)
You're my light guiding me
Through the darkest hour of my life (through the darkest hour of my life)
I'll never feel so ever
Feel so high (I feel so high)
Through the summer sunshine of our love
(Of our love)



Stormy wind blows with the night

No Fruits for Today Lyrics

Slowly down the avenue
And the irony of liking you
What was to be some brand new shoes
Now them color has come out pure blue
I'd love to love the sunshine through
But love in doubt will not have two
The novelty will outlast you
Comin' down the ledge will do

See it through
Me and you

Whoa, I love you when you love me
We're gonna make a big family
I love you when you love me
We're gonna make a big family
I love you when you love me
We're gonna make a big family
I love you when you love me
We're gonna make a big family

Driving down the afternoon
Something that can not be tuned
I'd love to make things out with you
But the flowers were too lame to move
Outside the signs were two by two
The novelty comes out to you
The Philadelphia blue lagoon
They're jumpin' up and down the moon


See it through
(Ah ha ha ha ha ha)


Yet the flowers were too lame to move

Oh, I love you when you love me
We're gonna make a big family
I love you when you love me
We're gonna make a big family

Avenue Lyrics

Waiting for hours and hours on end
It's a godsend for people
Who don't stay the same
Wasting in a garden where the sun comes to fade
They don't ever believe me
That life found us too late

Wasting on hours to end
Never for once to be sent

And give me an hour to save this for you
If you ever come near me
I'm set for that

Begging for others to stay
Resting for something that's great

We sail
For miles in the life of other's detail
In some crowded avenue today
Though we fail
To silence the lies, the cries, the glee as well
We know that the sun approves
For us to stay



Whatever happened to everyone's head?
There's a light in your face where
The others just shades

Bearing a life that sounds plain
Gives me to send mine astray

We sail
For miles in the life of other's detail
In some crowded avenue today
Though we fail
To silence the lies, the cries, the glee as well
We know that the sun approves
For us to stay

She’s So Beautiful Lyrics

She's so beautiful, she's so beautiful
She's so beautiful, she's so beautiful
She wakes me up with the sun in her eyes
Every morning, a warm surprise
She makes me laugh, she makes me sing
She gets me dancing, she has me swinging
She's so beautiful, she's so beautiful
She's so beautiful, oh yeah

I'm sailing the seas on a breeze, not a cloud in the sky
Never feeling lonely
I'm rocking her boat, let her float, see her drifting away
I don't need no answers
They're all in my head
And I've got no questions

She's so beautiful, she's so beautiful
She's so beautiful, she's so beautiful
She wakes me up with the sun in her eyes

She gets me dancing, she has me swinging
She's so beautiful, she's so beautiful
She's so beautiful, she's so beautiful


I'm roaming the streets on a beat and her voice in my head
Never feeling lonely
I'm driving for hours and hours on end in my car
But I'm not getting closer
And I never will
Forever climbing mountains

She's so beautiful, she's so beautiful
She's so beautiful, she's so beautiful

I'm walking on roses, I'm whistling, I'm loving the sun
I'm swimming in wine and I know that you're my number one
I'm drowning in happiness, I know that I'm losing my head
Summer is singing for the finest girl I ever met


She's so beautiful, she's so beautiful
She's so beautiful, she's so beautiful

In 1997 the Bullet Was Shy Lyrics

Oh, shiny beautiful metal
Fitting in, is it?
Well, we could all wonder
Should we?

Sinful recognition in my life
Goes without no one
Goes when those foes gone

Come, depart
Free
From freedom
This guilt
Come, it's thrilling

When my ignorance is biting
Friends will not fall down
Friends will surely found

Well, I do refuse to be abused by
The sickening conclusion
The deafening delusion
Of life that once I've known
Of life that once might have grown



By now resolution is aging
I fell for my own game
A game for all to shame

Well, I do refuse to be abused by
The sickening conclusion
The deafening delusion
Of life that once I've known
Of life that once might have grown
And I do refuse to be abused by
The sickening conclusion
The deafening delusion
Of life that once I've owned
Of life that once might have shown

My friend
This is a lovely morning for a haunting evening
Fare thee well, compadre
This is it for me

(Hey, you know?)
(You look so beautiful now)

Lirik ""Apatis Ria""

Semua sudah
Terasa mudah
Dan ber-holiday
Tak pernah usai
Segala tua muda
Merasa pudar
Apakah sudah
Terjalan

Merasuki usia
Menghantui, menyakiti

Tapi ku tak mudah
Merasa punah
Dan ber-holiday

Denganmu
Bersatu
Melupa suram
Dan nasibku
Berlalu
Inikah nikmatnya?

Juki doyan kambing

Dalam kata terdapat doa
Yang beriring dosa
Telah siapkah? Dia yang berdaya
Menghadapi masa

Sempatkah rasa menjadi raja?
Di atas segalanya
Apakah dunia sudah mendua
Terhadap asalnya?

Namun kita tetap berjaya
Mendatangkan duka
Terhempas menuju hidup
Yang membunuh suka

Terhamparkan luasnya
Maaf yang terjanjikan
Kau sambut hamparan
Yang tersaji indah



Namun kita tetap berjaya
Mendatangkan duka
Terhempas menuju hidup
Yang membunuh suka
Ah

Essensimo Lyrics

You say going under
Not too clever
In these days where life surrounds us
You fret to surrender
To a lesser
Pacifiying soul invader

Everybody stays in one place
It takes to know one
Avoid the wrong ones
Serene for the life to convey
It breaks to hold one
If one desires to sold the fire whole

Save it and have it
It fortifies the one desire
To hack it and to savor it
To elope


Save it and have it
(It fortifies the one desire)
And hack it, well damn it
(It glorifies the one desire)
To live in one delusion
To elope


Well, everybody stays in one place

Dan seiring paruh masa
Di selisih larut rasa
Kau beranjak penuh asa
Melenakan jiwa raya

Kau tertawa, berpeluk
Derita bercerita
Bersinari masyhur diri

Dan hantaran dalam sukma
Terlatih guratan raja
Kau terus berburu asa
Meragukan jiwa raya

Kau tertawa, berpeluk

Kau melati
Di belantara semak yang berduri
Melambai kisah

Dan angin sedang kencang-kencang berhembus

Siang lambat laun telah menjadi malam
Dan kini telah gelas ketiga
Jam sembilan malam aku pulang

Timur Lyrics
Lirik ""Timur""

Masa depan kadang menakutkan
Penuh dengan ketidakpastian
Lebih mudah jika tak dipikirkan
Kita bisa membuat rencana
Untuk sekian tahun ke depan
Tapi percuma jika selesai di tengah jalan

Namun tiap kudengar namamu
Makin terbayang masa depanku
Semakin jelas tujuan
Dan yang ku harus lakukan
Saat aku dan kamu bicara
Tentang harapan dan cita-cita
Semua yang kita damba
Akan terasa seperti
Amat nyata

Kadang kita takkan mendapatkan
Yang diinginkan dan dimimpikan
Semua usaha hanya sia-sia


Namun tiap kudengar namamu
Makin terbayang masa depanku
Semakin jelas tujuan
Dan yang ku harus lakukan
Saat aku dan kamu bicara
Tentang harapan dan cita-cita

Akan terasa seperti
Amat nyata

Aku tak bisa menjanjikan surga
Atau bahagia untuk selamanya
Tetapi jika engkau terus percaya
Pasti akan ada jalan

Namun tiap kudengar namamu
Makin terbayang masa depanku
Semakin jelas tujuan
Dan yang ku harus lakukan


Dan di hariku yang paling gelap
Semoga aku akan mengingat
Bahwa ini sementara

Dan kusadari kulewati pagi tanpa arti","A cup of coffee in the morning Talk about here and there Without realizing it, you can go through the day without nutrition I don't know what you want I wouldn't want to even if I knew Just say yes so that this discourse passes You criticize Philosophize And theorizing Without meaning, without content As if the one who understands best (Take time to think) (Never be easily offended) (Later you will be eliminated) Look around you Open your eyes There's still time There are many things you need to know I don't know what you want I wouldn't want to even if I knew Just say yes so that this discourse passes You criticize Philosophize And theorizing Without content, without meaning Your words are like a god (Take time to think) (Never be easily offended) (Later you will be eliminated) Look around you Open your eyes There's still time There are many things you need to know (Take time to think) (Never be easily offended) (Later you will be eliminated) Look around you Open your eyes There's still time For a different point of view Remember there are many more Things you need to know A cup of coffee, a slice of bread Talk about here and there And I realized I had spent the morning without meaning"

Masa-Masa Lyrics
Lirik ""Masa-Masa""

Kau selalu ada
Untuk tertawa
Tak pernah lupa
Dan meskipun salah
Ikuti saja
Karena muda
Jiwa remaja

Seia sekata bersama-sama
Seia sekata hadapi duka
Seia sekata canda tawa
Masa lalu dan sekarang
'Kan kita kenang di masa yang datang

Semangat bicara
Hal yang telah lama
Masa SMA
Perihal yang lucu
Waktu ke waktu
Yang telah berlalu
Liar menggebu

Seia sekata hadapi duka
Seia sekata canda tawa

Gelap Malam Lyrics
Lirik ""Gelap Malam""

Terjebaknya di dalam
Pikiran yang terkaram
Mungkinkah itu alasan
Dia tak henti menggeram
Malam yang melelahkan
Gelap dan tak berkawan
Sekat-sekat di lukanya
Semakin dalam

Kaukah itu?
Kebisuan gelap tanpa tanda
Membuat semua tak berdaya
Takkan ada
Jiwa yang penuhi dusta
Biarlah
Biar semua berjalan bersama
Tak usahlah kau berbeda
Masa lalu
Akankah terus menyala?

Terkapar dan bernyawa
Hilang ditelan masa
Ruang-ruang di hatinya
Akan terus menyala
Kekalnya keangkuhan
Melawan ketakutan
Dan gelap pagi yang samar
Terasa berbeda


Kaukah itu?
Kebisuan gelap tanpa tanda
Membuat semua tak berdaya
Takkan ada
Jiwa yang penuhi dusta
Biarlah
Biar semua berjalan bersama
Tak usahlah kau berbeda

He didn't stop growling A tiring night Dark and friendless Blocking the wound Deeper Is that you?

Prostrate and alive Lost in time The spaces in his heart Will stay lit Arrogance remains Fight fear And the faint darkness of the morning It feels different Is that you? Dark silence without a sign Making everyone helpless There won't be A soul full of lies Let it be Let everyone walk together You don't have to be different The past Will it stay lit? Is that you?

Itu Aku Lyrics


Pukul 2, pukul 3, cruisin’ I di Jakarta
Jam segini ‘dah pulang, today tak banyak kerja
Lalu lintas lumayan, aku lewat Senayan
Swerving in a Bimmer clean, menjemput my wanita
Menjemput cita-cita, menggunting pita-pita
Klise jadi pelita, gelap malam di kota
Driving down di Selatan, di ASEAN di perempatan
Muka siapa yang di papan iklan sepanjang jembatan?

(Itu aku, itu aku)
(Itu aku) Siapa yang tinggalkan yang tersayang demi kesempatan?
(Itu aku, itu aku)
Itu aku

Kau tak perlulah telepon, no you bukan family
Kau tak ada waktu, aku butuh sosok family
Back when aku tak punya, tak makan tak mengunyah
Walau kita pisah meja, wish you kenyang selamanya
Ku di Radio Dalam, juga dalam radio
Counting some of my income inside a nail studio
Nails done, hit the gym, gotta do my cardio
If you wanna get to me, kontak CP di bio


In my head a video, running round berulang-ulang
Coba-coba ingat-ingat, buat apa ku bеrkeringat?
Buat orang di rumah, walau jarak ni tak dekat
Buat kamu, dia, merеka, buat aku suka lupa
Buat semua ini, buat hati siapa punya?

(Itu aku, itu aku)
(Itu aku) Siapa yang tinggalkan yang tersayang demi kesempatan?
(Itu aku, itu aku)


(Itu aku, itu aku)

(That's me, that's me) (That's me) Who leaves their loved ones for chance? (That's me, that's me) That's me You don't need to call, your number is not family You don't have time, I need a family figure Even though we separate tables, I hope you are full forever Ku on Radio Dalam, also on radio In my head a video, running round over and over again Try to remember, why am I sweating?

Dan di luar terasa sungguh menggigilkan
Dan nyamuk-nyamuk banyak bertebaran
Aku hanya berkata peduli setan

Aku siap lontarkan semua kata

Senja di Ambang Pilu Lyrics

Bertegur sapa di kala senja
Memerah meredam nyala surya
Dengan dia yang mencuat dibatas kalbu
Memeluk hatiku yang dibelai rindu

Tak berdaya ku berada
Diambang waktu
'Tuk memulai pilu
Ku tenggelam ke dalam sepi
Ku ditelan sunyi memikirkanmu


Mendamba masa untuk bersua
Dengan dia yang melintas di malam syahdu
Melepas semua curah rasa
Menghempas beban dan nestapa
Terikat dalam kedamaian
Kala dua insan yang sedang terlena

Tak berdaya ku berada
Diambang waktu
'Tuk memulai pilu
Ku tenggelam ke dalam sepi
Ku ditelan sunyi merindukanmu

Tak berdaya ku tak berdaya
Diambang waktu
'Tuk memulai pilu
Ku tenggelam ke dalam sepi
Ku ditelan sunyi merindukanmu

Mengenal firasat tersimpan pada manusia
Tersirat buaian keresahan takkan melayang
Melayang...
Melayang...

Ku tenggelam ke dalam sepi
Ku ditelan sunyi memikirkanmu
Mendamba masa untuk bersua
Dengan dia yang melintas di malam syahdu
Melepas semua curah rasa
Menghempas beban dan nestapa
Terikat dalam kedamaian
Kala dua insan yang sedang terlena

Terpaut Oleh Waktu Lyrics


Tenggelam aku di rupamu
Ke palung rindu yang tersemu
Tak ada ruang yang tersisa dalam sendu
Tersimpan batas saat sayu mengadu
Kuingin kepadamu

Bayangmu ingin kucumbu
Tapi tersapu oleh sadarku
Nyatamu kian merayu
Terbius aku hingga membeku
Tapi ku terharu kau terpaut oleh waktu

Ada di Sana Lyrics

Kutergetar saat menatap kedua matamu
Melahirkan seutas keinginan 'tuk memilikimu
Kian bertahan memendam raut wajahmu
Kulihat sebuah jalan yang langsung menuju batinmu

Sudikah kiranya kau mengizinkan diriku
Untuk sejenak berkunjung ke dalam hatimu?
Pastikan 'ku ada di sana

Kuterbenam saat kau jatuh dalam pelukku
Menatap sebuah perasaan saat kau ada denganku

Sudikah kiranya kau mengizinkan diriku

Agar senantiasa tak kunjung engkau pergi

Berdistraksi Lyrics

Ku melangkah terseok 'tuk dibunuh waktu
Seingatku waktu itu kau bersamanya
Menjadi bulan-bulanan oleh perasaan
Ku diabaikan dalam sendu
Hatiku membiru
Terperangkap menggerutu

Mengalihkan peristiwa
Menantikan kenyataan
Yang tak kunjung usai sampai
Ujung waktu tiba hingga
Ku jatuh tenggelam dalam keresahan

Berhentilah
Agar ku sanggup tidur kali ini

Bersama turunnya butir embun yang perlahan

Wahai kau yang lahirkan resah saat kita berdua
Terpisah di tempat yang jauh 'tuk merindu

Seakan kita benar, tak peduli akan salah
Oh, karena hati dan rasa bicara

Kemarilah saat senja bertemu malam gelap

Wahai kau yang kerap menangis di pelukku
Tersedulah karena ku duduk di sampingmu

We don’t talk about this back home
Lock me up if I talk about this back home
Mistreated some of us back home
Colonized what’s left in the West back home

We sure play pretend back home
Picking scraps of what we used to call home
Cautious of how I use my phone
Fearful of how I set my tone

Can only sing these songs in English
I know my chance yeah so I’ll take the piss
I don’t have much time, let me finish
A little space for things to say

That got me oh, 
hated in the nation
I know I’ll be oh, hatеd in the nation, the nation

We can’t talk about this back homе
Tiptoe when you talk about home
I know you get demonized back home
Full speed, demolition back home

Unless I wanna sleep with the fishes
Saudara sedarah menangis

Ended from wounds and buried underground

Burned by sugar cane
""Hang in there"" you said

The last powerless crawled in a bloody chains

How could you woke you hate
While death is the new bed?

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
I hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

If we never learn we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullet?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, a bullet?

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
Things look pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here


We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before

Moon, a hole of light
Through the big top tent up high
Here before and after me
Shinin' down on me
Moon, tell me if I could
Send up my heart to you?
So when I die, which I must do
Could it shine down here with you?

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

My baby here on Earth
Showed me what my heart was worth
So when it comes to be my turn
Could you shine it down here for her?

Let It Grow Lyrics

You don't know me, but my name's Cy
I'm just the O'Hare delivery guy
But it seems like trees might be worth a try
So I say let it grow

My name is Dan

And my name's Rose

Our son, Wesley, kinda glows
And that's not good, so we suppose
We should let it grow

Let it grow, let it grow
You can't reap what you don't sow

Plant a seed inside the earth
Just one way to know its worth
Let's celebrate the world's rebirth
We say let it grow


My name's Marie, and I am three
I would really like to see a tree
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-lee
I say let it grow

I'm 
Grammy Norma
I'm old and I've got gray hair
But I remember when trees were everywhere
And no one had to pay for air
So I say let it grow

Let it grow, let it grow
Like it did so long ago
Maybe it's just one tiny seed
But it's all we really need
It's time to change the life we lead
Time to let it grow

My name's O'Hare
, 
I'm one of you
I live here in Thneedville too
The things you say just might be true
It could be time to start anew
And maybe change my point of view


Nah, ha-ha
, I say let it die!

Let it die, let it die
Let it shrivel up and—

Come on! Who's with me? Huh?

Nobody

You greedy dirtbag!

Let it grow, let it grow
Let the love inside you show
Plant a seed inside the earth
Just one way to know its worth
Let's celebrate the world's rebirth
We say let it grow
Woah, woah, woah, let it grow, let it grow
You can't reap what you don't sow
It's just one tiny seed
But it's all we really need
It's time to banish all your greed
Imagine Thneedville flowered and treed
Let this be our solemn creed

I'm starvin', darlin'
Let me put my lips to somethin'
Let me wrap my teeth around the world
Start carvin', darlin'
I wanna smell the dinner cookin'
I wanna feel the edges start to burn

Honey, I wanna race you to the table
If you hesitate, the gettin' is gone
I won't lie if there's somethin' to be gained
There's money to be made, whatever's still to come

Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinnin' the children for a war drum
Puttin' food on the table, sellin' bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young



You can't buy this fineness
Let me see the heat get to you
Let me watch the dressing start to peel
It's a kindness, highness
Crumbs enough for everyone
Old and young are welcome to the meal

Honey, I'm makin' sure the table's made
We can celebrate the good that we've done
I won't lie if there's somethin' still to take
There is ground to break, whatever's still to come

Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung

I saw this angel
 (Ooh)
I really saw an angel
 (Ooh, ooh)
Hey, hey
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Open up your eyes, shut your mouth and see
That I'm still the only one who's been in love with me
I'm just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
And there's nothing I can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling 'cross the floor
Couldn't take you home 
to mother in a skirt that short
But I think that's what I like about it

She's an angel (Ooh), only angel (Ooh)
She's an angel (Ooh), my only angel (Ooh)

I must admit I thought I'd like to make you mine
As I went about my business through the warning signs
End up meetin' in the hallway every single time
And there's nothin' we can do about it
Told it to her brother and she told it to me
That she's gonna be an angel, just you wait and see
When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets
And there's nothing she can do about it, hey, hey


She's an angel (Ooh), only angel (Ooh)
She's an angel (Ooh), my only angel (Ooh)
She's an angel (Ooh), only angel (Ooh)
She's an angel (Ooh), my only angel (Ooh)

Did you go and make promises you can't keep?

All Things End Lyrics
In “All Things End,” the surface interpretation leans toward the end of a romantic relationship, where the finite nature of such things is seen and understood without any cynicism. The song also takes up the…

A two-tonne weight around my chest feels like
It just dropped a twenty-storey height
If there was anyone to ever get through this life
With their heart still intact, they didn't do it right
The last time I felt your weight on my chest, you said
""We didn't get it right, but, love, we did our best""
And we will again

Movin' on in time and takin' more from
Everything that ends

And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
And slips right through our hands
And just knowin' that everything will end
Should not change our plans when wе begin again

We begin again, mm

I havе never known a silence like the one fallen here
Never watched my future darken in a single tear
I know we want this to go easy by bein' somebody's fault
But we've gone long enough to know this isn't what we want
And that isn't always bad


When people say that something is forever
Either way, it ends

And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
Or slips right through our hands
And just knowin' that everything will end
Should not change our plans

When we begin again
We begin again
We begin again, mm, darlin'

And all things end
All that we intend is built on sand
Slips right through our hands
And just knowin' that everything will end
Won't change our plans when we begin again

And all things end (Knowin' we can always start again)
All that we intend (Knowin' we have another day)
Is scrawled in sand (Knowin' we can always start again)
Or slips right through our hands (Knowin' we have another day)
And just knowing (Knowing we can always start again)
That everything will end

I Don’t Like My Mind Lyrics

I don't like my mind, I don't like being left alone in a room
With all its opinions about the things that I've done
So, yeah, I blast music loud and I work myself to the bone
And on an inconvenient Christmas, I eat a cake

A whole cake, all for me
Ooh, oh-oh

And then I get sick and throw up and there's another memory that gets stuck
Inside the walls of my skull waiting for its turn to talk
And it may be a few years, but you can bet it's there, waiting still
For me to be left alone in a room with the things that I've done

A whole cake, so please don't take

The Frost Lyrics

The frost, it looks like dust settled on the world
After everyone's long been gone
But me, I was hidin', or forgotten, the only one left
Now the world is mine alone

With no one, no one to share the memory
Of frost out the window
This morning after you're gone
And the house is mine alone

You're my best friend, now I've no one to tell
How I lost my best friend
The frost, it looks like we've been left in the attic
But you're not here to see

It's just witness-less me",https://genius.com/Mitski-the-frost-lyrics,"Polski

And cover up the driveway

Clear the path to drive to the store

Benar-benar terakhir

Menguap tak berbentuk
Nyata bukan pertanda

Saudade Lyrics
Lirik ""Saudade""

Dikatakan oleh angin
Yang menghasilkan gelombang
Jadilah besar bestari
Dan manfaat 'tuk sekitar
Dikatakan awan hitam
Sebelum datangnya hujan
Biarlah aku dikutuk
Dan engkau yang dirayakan

Perjalanan takdir dan kenangan
Berselimut doa
Hangatnya akan terjaga

Selalu ada
Menemanimu
Sampai kita
Dihapuslah
Jadi besar dan bestari
Serap yang baik untukmu

Oh di sana
Berdirilah engkau
Dengan senyuman dan keping harapan
Di belakang
Tempatmu bersandar
Tanganku terbuka
Kapan pun kau ingat
Pulang

a feeling Lyrics


Don’t know what to do with this song, I just know that I got a feeling
A foreign city and I’m all alone, all I got is this certain feeling
Did I take this away from home? Don’t know how to describe this feeling
Tried everything just to overcome this exact particular feeling
Don’t know what to do with this song (this song), I just know that I got a feeling
A foreign city and I’m all alone, all I got is this certain feeling
Did I take this away from home? Don’t know how to, to describe this feeling
Tried everything just to overcome (overcome) this exact particular feeling

Somebody help! I think I might just drown
Deep inside, pull me out, I haven’t got enough sleep
I guess I found the key to my success
I confess that I’m rambling, a mess
This is me at my best

I think this is me at my best
When I’m overwhelmed by a feeling then that’s me at my best
I’m a big bowl of chaos, I choke the world when I cry
I think that’s when I’m at my best

(My best, my best, my best) Doves flying up in the air
Just a bit outside my reach, sing for me your gift of freedom
Don’t wanna be like this anymore
I guess I’m nothing at my best
I guess I’m nothing at my best

I want you to the bone
Have I ever called you
When you are all alone
And if I ever forget
To tell you how I feel
Listen to me now, babe
I want you to the bone

I want you to the bone, oh-oh-oh
I want you to the bone, oh-oh-oh

Maybe if you can see
What I feel through my bone
Every corner in me
There's your presence that grown
Maybe I nurture it more
By saying how I feel
But I did mean it before
I want you to the bone
I want you to

Take me home, I’m fallin'
Love me long, I'm rollin’
Losing control, 
body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Walk you down, I'm all in
Hold you tight, you call and
I'll take control your 
body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours


Would that be alright?
Hey, would that be alright?

I want you to the bone, oh-oh-oh
So bad I can't breathe, mm-oh-oh
I want you to the bone

Of all the ones that begged to stay
I'm still longing for you
Of all the ones that cried their way
I'm still waiting on you
Maybe we seek for something that
We couldn’t ever have
Maybe we choose the only love
We know we won’t accept
Or maybe we're taking all the risks
For something that is real
’Cause 
maybe the greatest love of all
Is who the eyes can't see
, yeah


Take me home, I'm fallin'
Love me long, I’m rollin'
Losing control, 
body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Walk you down, I'm all in
Hold you tight, I call and
I'll take control your 
body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours, oh-oh


Oh yeah
(Would you just take me home?)
(Would you just love me long?)
(Or should I keep hoping on?)
(Should I keep hoping on?)
(Could I just take you home?)
(Could I just love you long?)
(Or should I keep hoping on?)

I want you to the bone, oh-oh-oh

Monolog Lyrics


Gelap
Di dalam tanya
Menyembunyikan rahasianya
Letih
Kehabisan kata
Dan kita pada akhirnya diam

Bunga
Dibulan sepi
Jatuh terdampar
Tersasar

Alasan masih bersama bukan
Karena terlanjur lama
Tapi rasanya
Yang masih sama
Seperti sejak pertama jumpa
Dirimu di kala senja
Duduk berdua
Tanpa suara


Rindu
Yang jatuh di kamarku
Hanyalah rindu yang datang padamu

Bertanya
""mengapa kita
Masih di sini
Tersenyum?"", yeah, yeah

Because it's been a long time But it feels Which is still the same Like since we first met You at dusk Sit together No sound Miss you Which fell in my room Only longing comes to you Ask ""Why us Still here Smile?"", yeah, yeah The reason they're still together isn't it?

One Only Lyrics

Oh
There you are
Sittin' still all stripes and lonely
Hidin', wishin', waitin'
While I'm

Standin' still stare at you only
Everythin' gets blurry

All I want is just to stay

Start countin' all the days
Forever I will stay with you
With you, one only you
Go far and roam about
Comeback and callin' out to me
To me, one only me

I Love You But I’m Letting Go Lyrics

Hmm, no

Sunday night after a rainy day
I delete all your pictures
I walked away from you
Nights are the hardest
But I'll be okay
If we are meant to be
Yeah, we’ll find our way
But now, let it be

'Cause you know what they say
If you love somebody
Gotta set them free

I love you but I'm letting go
I love you but I’m letting go
I love you and I'm letting go
I love you but I'm letting go

Little did I know love is easy
But why was it so hard?
It was like never enough
I gave you all still you want more
Can't you see? can't you see?
That you want someone that I'm not
Yes, I love but I can't
So, I am letting you go now


And baby one day
When you finally found what you want
And you're ready to open your heart to anyone
Don’t push people away again
Easier, I know
But it’s also very lonely

Yeah, oh, oh

I love you but I'm letting go
I love you but I’m letting go
I love you and I'm letting go
It is the only way, you know? oh

And from now on
I will hold my own hand
Until one day you'll hold
My lonely hand

Sorry Lyrics

Sometimes I can't be on my own
Or else I'll think too much again
And it's about what I did wrong
Times like this I wish you're here
With me
Oh, yeah

For all the things I didn't do
And all the love that haven't got to you
I'm sorry
I wish I could turn back the time
And let you know, I never meant to hurt you
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

I miss us when I'm on my own
Or now I feel too much again?
It's plain and cold after you're gone
Times like this I wish you're here
With me

Flying Solo Lyrics

Won’t be home for now
I'm on a break
Detaching for a while
I grow my hair so then
I could get out
And start to rock the world

Without thinking of you
I'm free
No more thoughts about you
And me

I'm flying solo
I'll fly without you
I'll go by myself
I'm flying solo
I'll spread my own wings
I'll hibernate and sing
I'm flying solo (so, so, so low, so, so, so low)
I'm flying solo (so, so, so low, so low)

You do you for now
I'm all I need
I'm good, I'm solo now
Swallow all the pain
I'm fine again
Not dead, I'm stronger now


And I learned to say no
To you
Then I learned to let go
Oh whoa oh

I'm flying solo
I'll fly without you
I'll go by myself
I'm flying solo
I'll spread my own wings
I'll hibernate and sing
I'm flying solo

I'm flying solo (so, so, so low, so low)

Break It Lyrics

I miss the warmth of having someone's glow
Going slowly to my direction
Solitude is a bliss it is but I am
Missing the warmth of having someone's glow

Go on and take my heart and break it
Go on and own it then corrupt it
Because I miss being in love before I watch it all slowly fall apart
And crushed to the start
So go on and take my heart and ache it
Go on and fix my heart then break it
(Hey)

I need the thrill to gamble all the odds
Meaningless game, the art of overthink
Love is a bitch, it is I know but I am
Needing the thrill
From feelin' something original
And puzzly delusional, oh
Do you know what I mean?

Go on and take my heart and break it
Go on and own it then corrupt it
Because I miss being in love before I watch it all slowly fall apart
And crushed to the start
So go on and take my heart and break it
Let it all crumble then decrypt it
Because I miss the full circle of love
The beauty and all it's aftermath
Is it too much to ask?
Go on and take my heart and ache it
Go on and fix my heart


'Cause in the end the days are numbered
And I hope this loneliness won't stay
I'm not havin' it cause it's been too long
Oh, it's been such a long way down
Now I am low on love and it's aftermath
I'm low on hugs and kisses
On jealousy and heartache

Modern Love Lyrics

Art is turnin', the world is endin'
Love changin' (love changin')
No one talks and fingers wander
Boredom lingers (boredom lingers)

Hmm, emojis sent as a hello
While we let our feelings grow
And grow and grow and grow
I know
(modern love)

My words are flyin', your lips are smilin'
Our hopes are buildin' (our hopes are buildin')
But I don't care 'cause I'm sure that you know that
Nothin' lasts (nothin' lasts)

Though we are well aware for sure
The two of us low-key wish for more
And more and more and more
I know

I want it to be you, you want it to be me
You've got nothin' to lose, I'm lonely as can be
We've been longing for something good
Even die for it, oh we would
You don't want forever, I'll take whenever
We are the youth, this is modern love
(this is modern love, modern love)


Fucks and kisses, easiest access
I want more (I want more)
'Cause my tired soul that seeks for home
Is here to stay

Emojis sent to let you know
That maybe it's best to let it flow
And flow and flow, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yes

I want it to be you, you want it to be me
You've got nothin' to lose, I'm lonely as can be
I wanted to be loved, you wanted to be free
I want it to be you, you want it to be me
We've been longing for something good
Even die for it, oh we would
You don't want forever, I'll take whenever
We are the youth, this is modern love

The Retirement of U Lyrics

The retirement of you

Well I'm feelin' like a whole, can't get any better, I'm
Together together, like together together
Not crazy over vibration or notification
I'm feelin' like a whole
I'm feelin' at my ease, I do things as I please
I faced my biggest fear and found out very clear
It's okay to be stupid, it's okay not to push it
It's okay, it's okay

Well I'm gonna loosen up for now
Gonna have a celebration

The retirement of you
The retirement of you
The retirement of you
Ooh ooh oh oh oh mm oh oh yeah

You're feelin' at your best, I hope that is the case
'Cause love, I bleed for you, did things I can't undo
My friends said, ""Mate, it's alright
Be happy, future is bright
Fuck who didn't stay,"" Mom too said she pray
All I wanna do for now is nothing
All I wanna do for now is nothing
(I'm feelin' like a whole, can't get any better)
(Together together like together together)


It's the retirement of you
The retirement of you
Oh yeah, it's the retirement of you
The retirement of you
Ooh ooh oh oh oh mm oh oh yeah

It's the retirement of you

Yes I'm feelin' so alone, sometimes I'm on my own
I think a lot, I do, and 
'Once' was about you
Then I get up for a ride, as usual midnight drive
As I'm feelin' the night, I realize I was right

It's the retirement of you
(And if I don't find replacement of you)
(You know I don't mind, I've got myself too)
It's the retirement of you, oh yes
(And if I don't find replacement of you)
It's the retirement of you, I've got myself too
(You know I don't mind, I've got myself too)
Oh I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna

Oh no, love, I don't mind, love

Wait a Minute Lyrics

All alone in my old car
Driving fast, driving too far
All alone in my old car
Heading south, going back home to you

All alone with the street lights
Moving faster, now it's midnight
All alone, with the street lights
Heading south, going back home to you

Your arms
Where I belong
Always

Well, wait a minute
I am on my way
I am on my way back home to you
Promise I'll be there
I'll be there just in time
Just a minute
Wait a minute
Oh, oh


Bones are aching, I miss you, you know?
Crave your kiss, now I need you
Fill me now 'cause I want you
Wait a minute till I get back to you

The battle is off now
I'm coming back
Now will be no more days
You'll have to wait
And when your nights are low
And when you feel so strong
I'll be around, I'll be around
But you gotta, you gotta

Wait a minute
I am on my way
I am on my way back home to you
Promise I'll be there
I'll be there just in time

It's getting closer now
It's getting closer to be home to you
Promise you'll stay there
And I'll be there just in time

Nice Day Lyrics

I need a place to be
I need a space to be myself again
I'm ready to go
Just take me somewhere I can breathe again
Where there's so much love, oh yes
Where there's so much love I can hold again
Somewhere to call home
'Cause I had a good time, a good time

But until tomorrow
Let me forget 'bout today

'Cause every now and then
My weariness left my senses gone
And I couldn't feel a thing
And everyone, they're home
And you know from time to time
My hands are numb and my feet are dead
And I have no one to meet and hold and more
So would you just take me and take me and take me
It's been a long day
It's been a long day
It's a nice day
It's a nice day


Though I know that now
The evening's vanished to its hand
But the silence here
Somewhat is too loud for dreamin'
Still I have more
Still I have more fuel I could spend
But nowhere to go
I don't wanna find myself lonely again

Disappearing
Through the echoes of my mind
Wanderin' around
And get twisted behind
I need to end it well
Without having to ruin the whole day
'Cause it's been a nice day
It's been a nice day
It's a long day

So until tomorrow
Let me end it well today

'Cause every now and then
My weariness left my senses gone
And I couldn't feel a thing
And everyone, they're home
And you know from time to time
My hands are numb and my feet are dead
And I have no one to meet and hold and more
So would you just take me and take me and take me
'Cause every now and then
My weariness makes my whole heart lone
And I didn't mind at all
But maybe not today, oh
'Cause baby from time to time
On days like these I thought to myself
Why I have no one to meet and hold and more
So would you just take me and take me and take me

I didn't know much about love

Intentions Lyrics

Don't know what I'm doing
All my feeling speaks
In the way that you won't
Understand its meaning
Words are out of reach
Then there comes the silence

It gets in the way between us
Can't you just see it in my eyes
That I just need you to let you know that I

Ooh, I just wanna love you right
Free you so you shine your lights
Can't you see it?
Ooh, I just wanna kiss you right
Saying everything without
A word or two

I've lost the sense of me
In pitch dark I go
Swim into your palette


Closing out the gap between us
Pretty sure you see it in my eyes
That I just wanna let you know that I

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
And I'm not mad about it
No I'm not mad about it
Oh, ooh

Yeah, I just wanna love you right

A word or two
Ooh, I just wanna love you right

Oh, yeah


I don't know what is up with you

All Good Lyrics

Lights out
The ghost that you've been chasing coming closer
In the night's out
The ones you thought are hidin' undercover

Now it's gone
You go ahead, keep what I said
Keep holding on
I'm sure it's gone
You go ahead, keep what I said
Keep moving on
We won't let ourselves down

Hey, oh, you gotta let go
All your sorrow
All of your love for tomorrow
I know we're gonna be
Stronger than you'll ever know
Hey, oh, you gotta let go
All your sorrow
All of your love for tomorrow
I know we're gonna be
It's all good
It's all good


Have you wondered
Why we were never meant for one another
Cure my hunger
I'm craving for the good touch to recover

Now it's gone
You've gone ahead, keep fall aside
Keep holding on
I'm sure it's gone
You've gone ahead, keep fall aside
Keep moving on
We won't let ourselves down

Rayuan Perempuan Gila Lyrics


Menurutmu berapa lama lagi kau kan mencintaku?
Menurutmu apa yang bisa terjadi dalam sewindu?
Bukan apa, hanya bersiap, tak ada yang tahu, aku takut
Tak pernah ada yang lama menungguku sejak dulu

Yang terjadi sebelumnya
Semua orang takut padaku

Memang tidak mudah
Mencintai diri ini
Namun aku berjanji
Akan mereda seperti semestinya

Menurutmu apa benar saat ini kau masih mencintaku?
Menurutmu apa yang bisa dicinta dari diriku?
Bukan apa, hanya bersiap, tak ada yang tahu, aku takut
Tak pernah ada yang lama menungguku sejak dulu

Yang terjadi sebelumnya
Semua orang takut padaku


Panggil aku perempuan gila
Hantu berkepala, keji membunuh kasihnya
Penuh ganggu di dalam jiwanya
Sambil penuh cinta diam-diam berusaha
Selalu tahu akan ditinggalkan
Namun demi Tuhan aku berusaha!

Memang tidak mudah
Mencintai diri ini
Namun aku berjanji
Akan mereda seperti semestinya

There has never been anyone waiting for me for a long time since the past What happened before Everyone is afraid of me It's not easy Love yourself But I promise It will subside as it should Do you think it's true that you still love me now? What do you think there is to love about me? There has never been anyone waiting for me for a long time since the past What happened before Everyone is afraid of me Call me crazy woman A vicious headed ghost killed his love Full of disturbance in his soul While full of love, secretly trying Always knowing you'll be left behind But by God I tried!

Sorai Lyrics

Langit dan laut saling membantu
Mencipta awan, hujan pun turun
Ketika dunia saling membantu
Lihat, cinta mana yang tak jadi satu

Kau memang manusia sedikit kata
Bolehkah aku yang berbicara?
Kau memang manusia tak kasat rasa
Biar aku yang mengemban cinta

Awan dan alam saling bersentuh
Mencipta hangat, kau pun tersenyum
Ketika itu kulihat syahdu
Lihat, hati mana yang tak akan jatuh

Kau memang manusia sedikit kata
Bolehkah aku yang berbicara
Kau memang manusia tak kasat rasa
Biar aku yang mengemban cinta

Kau dan aku saling membantu
Membasuh hati yang pernah pilu
Mungkin akhirnya tak jadi satu

Rumpang Lyrics

Pagi tadi aku masih menangis
Ada rasa yang tak kunjung mati
Ada seseorang di atasku
Menahan semua rasa malu
Sempat ku berpikir masih bermimpi
24/7 tanpa henti
Matahari dan bulan saksinya
Ada rasa yang tak mau hilang

Aku takut sepi tapi yang lain tak berarti

Katanya mimpiku 'kan terwujud
Mereka lupa tentang mimpi buruk
Tentang kata maaf, sayang aku harus pergi
Sudah kuucap semua pinta
Sebelum ku memejamkan mata
Tapi selalu saja kamu tetap harus pergi

Sempat ku berpikir masih bermimpi
Bertahun berlanjut tanpa henti
Kulitmu yang memudar saksinya
Tetap rasaku tak pernah hilang


Aku takut sepi tapi yang lain tak berarti

Katanya mimpiku 'kan terwujud
Mereka lupa tentang mimpi buruk
Tentang kata maaf, sayang aku harus pergi
Sudah kuucap semua pinta
Sebelum ku memejamkan mata
Tapi selalu saja kamu tetap harus pergi

Banyak yang tak ku ahli
Begitu pula menyambutmu pergi

Begitu pula menyambutmu tak kembali

Bertaut Lyrics


Bun, hidup berjalan seperti bajingan
Seperti landak yang tak punya teman
Ia menggonggong bak suara hujan
Dan kau pangeranku mengambil peran

Apalagi saat kujadi juara
Saat tak tahu arah kau di sana
Menjadi gagah saat 'ku tak bisa

Agar seisi dunia tahu

Keras kepalaku sama denganmu
Caraku marah, caraku tersenyum
Seperti detak jantung yang bertaut
Nyawaku nyala kar'na denganmu
Aku masih ada sampai di sini
Melihatmu kuat setengah mati
Seperti detak jantung yang bertaut

Semuanya berenang di kepala
Dan kau dan semua yang kau tahu tentangnya

Diciumnya api marahku
Ternyata kacau bisa luluh

Jauh dari seram yang selama ini telah kubayangkan

Berteriak di atas tenggorokan
Hujan serapah dan makian
Hancur lebih mudah dari bertahan
Kupelajari sedari kecil

Dan dari situ cara pandangku
Melihat cinta berwarna keruh
Seperti bertaruh apa kau dan aku
Akan jadi sama seperti itu

Aku punya harapan 'tuk kita
Yang masih kecil di mata semua
Walau takut kadang menyebalkan
Tapi sepanjang hidup 'kan kuhabiskan
Walau tak terdengar masuk akal
Bagi mereka yang tak percaya
Tapi kita punya kita
Yang akan melawan dunia


Aku sudah tahu dari awal
Rasa takut masih kugenggam nyaman
Cinta dan jenisnya seperti seram
Kupelajari sedari kecil

Dan dari situ cara pandangku
Melihat cinta berwarna keruh
Seperti bertaruh apa kau dan aku
Akan jadi sama seperti itu

Seperti Tulang Lyrics
Lirik ""Seperti Tulang""

Kecil, wajahmu meraut sedih
Siapa yang berlayar pergi
Melatihmu sendiri
Menertawakan sunyi
Sampai hatimu lupa
Terbiasa perih

Kecil, seorang penipu mahir
Sehingga tak ada lagi tanya
Apakah kau tak apa
Menertawakan rintih
Sampai ragamu lupa
Terbiasa letih

Tawa harusnya minta maaf
Padamu yang lama ia tinggalkan

Tak sepenuhnya merasa sembuh
Dari luka
Dari luka
Dari luka


Kecil, aku pun meraut sedih
Semua karena tak lagi bisa
Memelukmu sempurna
Menertawakan hari
Sampai dirimu lupa

Tak sepenuhnya merasa sembuh
Dari luka
Dari luka
Dari luka
Dari luka

Seperti tulang yang patah
Dan tumbuh tidak sempurna",https://genius.com/Nadin-amizah-seperti-tulang-lyrics,"Lirik ""Seperti Tulang""

Laughing at the groans Until your body forgets Usually tired Laughter should be apologetic The one he left behind for a long time Didn't feel completely healed From wounds From wounds From wounds Small, I also frowned sadly All because I can no longer do it Hugs you perfectly Laugh at the day Until you forget Didn't feel completely healed From wounds From wounds From wounds From wounds Like broken bones And it doesn't grow perfectly"

Lend me your palm
I have brought you a star
As bright as who you are
But not enough as lovely as what you are

They can grant me a wish
And guide me home when I have to
But you’re the one I pray for
And the sanctuary I will go back to

I might have to return you to the sky tonight
But now it feels like you make everything alright
I might have never told you but with you
Feel like everything is right

Whisper me a kiss
You can draw me your dreams
It’s safe inside this tiny house
Where we both understand of who we are

I might have to return you to the sky tonight

Berpayung Tuhan Lyrics


Biar kita tinggal di angkasa
Bersama selama-lama lama-lamanya
Beralas awan, berpayung Tuhan yang baik
Hendak jauh dekat, tetapi selalu lebur

Biar kita jadi doa yang nyata
Bermuara pada lapang yang indah
Tahu tujuan, hilang pun tetap kembali
Hendak jauh dekat, tetapi selalu lebur

Jalan panjang kita
Semoga menyenangkan
Semua menjaga dari kiri-kanan
Senang mereka melihat kita senang


Biar di sela nafasmu
Tenang terus jadi satu
Biar di telapak kakimu
Halus dan kuat melaju
Biar di peluk ibumu
Kekal wangi tanpa rindu
Biar di bawah kasurmu
Mimpimu siap terbangun
Biar di dalam hatimu
Harum selalu namaku
Biar saat air surut
Bahagiamu terbangun

Di ujung malam menuju pagi yang dingin
Hanya ada sedikit bintang malam ini
Mungkin karena kau sedang cantik-cantiknya

Kadang juga ia takut
Tatkala harus berpapasan di tengah pelariannya

Sedikit cemas banyak rindunya

Di Atas Meja Lyrics

Di atas meja rindu itu hilang
Dalam kata-kata
Sebentar lagi kita saling lupa

Kita menjelma pagi dingin yang dipayungi kabut
Tak bisa lagi bercerita apa adanya

Mengapa takut pada lara
Sementara semua rasa bisa kita cipta
Akan selalu ada tenang
Disela-sela gelisah yang menunggu reda

Di dalam kamar rindu itu menguap
Dalam kebisuan
Sebentar lagi kita semakin lupa

Kita menjelma kebisuan yang tak bisa diungkap
Tak bisa lagi bercerita apa adanya

Mengapa takut pada lara
Sementara semua rasa bisa kita cipta
Akan selalu ada tenang
Disela-sela gelisah yang menunggu reda


Di tiap langkah rindu kita menghilang
Penuh keraguan
Lalu kita pun sungguh smakin lupa
Oooo..

Kita menjelma kebisuan yang tak kunjung terungkap

Mari Bercerita Lyrics

Seperti yang biasa kau lakukan
Ditengah perbincangan kita
Tiba-tiba kau terdiam
Sementara ku sibuk menerka
Apa yang ada difikiranmu
(huu uu)
(huu uu)

Sesungguhnya berbicara dengan mu
Tentang segala hal yang bukan tentang kita
Mungkin tentang ikan paus di laut
Atau mungkin tentang bunga padi di sawah
Sungguh bicara dengan mu
Tentang segala hal yang bukan tentang kita
Selalu bisa membuat semua lebih bersahaja hooo..
[Chorus: Is & 
Icha
]
Malam jangan berlalu
Jangan datang dulu terang
Telah lama kutunggu

Berdua Saja Lyrics
Ada yang tak sempat tergambarkan oleh kata
Ketika kita berdua
Hanya aku yang bisa bertanya
Mungkinkah kau tahu jawabnya
Malam jadi saksinya
Kita berdua diantara kata
Yang tak terucap
Berharap waktu membawa keberanian
Untuk datang membawa jawaban
Mungkinkah kita ada kesempatan
Ucapkan janji takkan berpisah selamanya",https://genius.com/Payung-teduh-berdua-saja-lyrics,"Ada yang tak sempat tergambarkan oleh kata

Selalu Muda Lyrics

Pada setiap malam yang gelap
Pada fajar yang muram
Pada mimpi yang manja
Pada rindu yang memuja
Pada senyuman yang menua

Hasrat berlapis mekarnya seperti seruni
Kusentuh wajahmu di mimpi yang sunyi
Dekapan tulus membuai nurani
Tak kunjung kutemui dimana kau bersembunyi

Kenangan menjelma dupa
Harumnya merasuk kemana-mana
Membelai helai rindu yang selalu muda

Rahasia Lyrics

Tak ada sore dan udara menjadi segar
Tak ada gelap, lalu mata enggan menatap
Tak ada bintang mati, butiran pasir terbang ke langit
Tak ada fajar hanya remang malam
Semua tlah hilang terserah matahari

Harum mawar membunuh bulan
Rahasia tetap diam tak terucap
Untuk itu semua aku mencarimu

Berikan tanganmu jabat jemariku
Yang kau tinggalkan hanya harum tubuhmu
Berikan suaramu balas semua bisikanku
Memanggil namamu
Atau kau ingin aku berteriak sekencang-kencangnya
Agar seluruh ruangan ini bergetar oleh suaraku

Harum mawar membunuh bulan

Untuk Perempuan Yang Sedang Di Pelukan Lyrics

Tak terasa gelap pun jatuh
Di ujung malam
Menuju pagi yang dingin
Hanya ada sedikit bintang malam ini
Mungkin karena kau
Sedang cantik-cantiknya

Lalu mataku merasa malu
Semakin dalam
Ia malu kali ini
Kadang juga ia takut
Tatkala harus
Berpapasan di tengah pelariannya

Di malam hari
Menuju pagi
Sedikit cemas
Banyak rindunya

Menuju Senja (Live) Lyrics


Harum mawar di taman
Menusuk hingga ke dalam sukma
Yang menjadi tumpuan rindu cinta bersama
Di sore itu menuju senja

Bersama hati yang terluka
Tertusuk pilu, menganga luka itu
Di antara senyum yang menapaki jejak kenangan

Di sore yang gelap ditutupi awan
Bersama setangkup bunga
Cerita yang kian merambat di dinding penantian
Ada yang mati saat itu dalam kerinduan
(dalam kerinduan)
Yang tak terobati

Harum mawar di taman
Menusuk hingga ke dalam sukma
Dan menjadi tumpuan rindu cinta bersama
Di sore itu menuju senja


Baru saja ku beranjak
Beberapa saat sebelum itu
Ada yang mati menuju sore
Menuju senja bersama..

Siaing anukku, anummu maneng anri
Mugiling paleppangiaq rupa mabboja

Dan dingin yang kau damba-dambakan
Dengan apa akan engkau habiskan
Bersama mimpi yang kau rekayasa
Atau doa-doa yang kau pinta dalam takut

Ditembok yang tinggi dan berlumut itulah
Segala peristiwa ikut melapuk
Kita menguap seperti kabut
Kita hanya sebentar
Sejenak adalah usia kita

Datang dan menguap begitu saja
Hanya aromanya yang tertanam di kepala
Seberapa banyak kau hirup malam ini kasih


Suara hujan merdu digarasi yang basah
Petikan sitar yang lincah dalam tentak tabu
Kau sungguh kontras malam ini
Mengalun disela rintik rindu yang sengit
Menarilah denganku
Pesanku pada malam-malam yang tenang dan sunyi
Mintalah lewat doa yang kau ucap dengan mesra

Sinar bulan sembunyikan segala cerita
Yang mungkin telah kau simpan
Sirna dalam kelam

Menepilah wahai Tuan
Berpeluh lukamu nan muram
Hiduplah asa..

Is It the Answer? Lyrics

I make you break, you move I take
Love is the answer so they say
But if I went away, what would you say
Would it be enough to make you stay?
As you look to the exit
I don't even know why I'd do this anymore
I know, there's things I should know

And I know you can't accept she's the love that I kept
Scared I'll push you away, but I love you everyday
I know there's things you should know

I'm in love not because I want to
She's become something that I got to see
Won't you just stick around with me?
Oh and darling
I mistake intent for better days
While you misled me in different ways
I don't think this is how it's to end

Alexandra Lyrics

Just like a certain motorbike gang from Charming
Or you're looking for the old ultraviolence
You're trouble, yes I knew
Right from the start

And the labyrinth I thought I knew
Rearranged to shape anew
At amazement of the excitement
That once rang true

And if I was a fool for you
I'd wait 500 million hours
On a park bench out on the moon
But in full view of what you are
Oh

Just like a feline with multiple lines
She lost a couple but she used to have five
A savior of mankind

And if I was a fool for you
I'd wait 500 million hours
On a park bench out on the moon
But in full view of what you are
You're a goddess, you're my rock star


I fell in love with Alexandra
Even though I barely met her
Even though we'd break our hearts
Before we'd even start
(Before we'd even start)

I'd wait 500 million hours
On a park bench out on the moon
But in full view of what you are
You're a goddess, you're my rock star
I fell in love with Alexandra
Even though I barely met her
Even though we'd break our hearts
Before we'd even start
(Before we'd even start)
And if I was a fool for you
I'd wait 500 million hours
On a park bench out on the moon
But in full view of what you are
You're a goddess, you're my rock star","Just like a certain motorbike gang from Charming Or you're looking for the old ultraviolence You're trouble, yes I knew Right from the start And the labyrinth I thought I knew Rearranged to shape anew At amazement of the excitement That once rang true And if I was a fool for you I'd wait 500 million hours On a park bench out on the moon But in full view of what you are Oh Just like a feline with multiple lines A savior of mankind And if I was a fool for you I'd wait 500 million hours On a park bench out on the moon But in full view of what you are You're a goddess, you're my rock star I fell in love with Alexandra Even though I barely met her Even though we'd break our hearts Before we'd even start (Before we'd even start) And if I was a fool for you I'd wait 500 million hours On a park bench out on the moon But in full view of what you are You're a goddess, you're my rock star"

Elastic Hearts Lyrics

All day I think of you
What can I do?
Counting days away
While I hope you stay
I thought this was the end
Of days that we'd spend
I know it's hard to see another way
But darling

Well is it too late to say
That I wanted
To stay a little while longer?

And now all I see
Are different parts of you
We were so damn free
And it was just us two

Well is it too late to say
That I wanted
To stay until 
the end?
(Stay until the end, stay until the end)


Elastic hearts, you bend but you don't break
You stretch, you give an inch
And then you take back what was mine before
Elastic hearts, you burn me up inside (burn me up inside)
You take me way too high
Just to shun me far away
From the light


Well is it too late to say
That I wanted
To stay until 
the end?
(Stay until the end, stay until the end)

Elastic hearts, you bend but you don't break
You stretch, you give an inch
And then you take back what was mine before
Elastic hearts, you burn me up inside (burn me up inside)
You take me way too high
Just to shun me far away

2112 Lyrics

I'll fully comprehend why the 21st of December
Rings heavy on my battle-worn heart

But who are we kidding?
Nobody's winning
In this tale of past and future love

They were just 20
Show us the money
A smoke show picturesque
Affair
It started as all things do
A simple hello turned to
Romantic visions far
Away

They were too clever
For it to be never
As they sunk into each other's arms

And this is the part
Where our whole lives collide
The stars themselves fell
Like we did that night
Though it felt like the universe knew
A pack of friends who couldn't hold their laughter
They chose to be painfully obvious in front of us
Slightly unaware or in denial of the dangers ahead
We thrust our weary hearts into each other's arms
Content and comfortable
For years to come


They felt it right and true
Blessings and kisses
As they thought it was the universe's wishes
And though they could feel it then
It's not how they want to end
So they turn their heads away
As if they were to say goodbye

But clocks keep on ticking
And life keeps on going
To leave the pair behind at last
[Spoken word: Faiz & 
Fathia
]
She said to me
And I said to her
To hold back each other's true fate
Is not of our nature
Let's be mature
Maybe you weren't made for me
Nor I for you
But I'd be damn lying
If I think that that's true

We were young and we were old
Life was warm then life was cold
It gets harder, yes you'll see
But were we ever meant to be?
We were young and we were old
Life was warm then life was cold
It gets harder, yes you'll see
But were we ever meant to be?
We were young and we were old
Life was warm then life was cold
It gets harder, yes you'll see
But were we ever meant to be?

Telenovia Lyrics

All along the west, we look to the east
The answer's there in silhouettes
But silver's all above our heads

All along we were addicted
To the kind of shape our pain afflicted
Wrestling till the monochrome moonlight
It's a shade that we will never be

I know
I'm wasting my time by leaving you behind
I know
A couple of weeks ago you were
So vivid in my mind

When I wake up tomorrow
Will I see another dawn?
As the days turn so hollow
Will I stare across my lawn
To find you whispering
Stranger things
My love
I can't explain at all
I crave to hear the fiction when you call
Your alibi's mistaken
But I'm so lost and taken
Don't set me straight


[Spoken word: Faiz and 
Fathia
]
Mi vida, por favor
Ven conmigo
Empezaremos nuestra vida lejos de acá
No puedo amor
Mi vida, mi familia es acá
Ni quiero nada más en este mundo pero
Pero no puedo
Bueno
Está bien si lo que quieras
Aunque tenemos que decir adiós
Recuérdate que
Siempre te amare

Will I see another dawn?

You’ll Find Lovers Like You and Me Lyrics

The oceans at midnight, melancholic and seaside
I watched you walk away from me and
What a sight, what a night, I can't think straight
Although it ended it won’t ever be a mistake

Though I think we were meant to be, we’d make it work far as I can see
You’ll find lovers like you and me, you’ll find lovers like you and me
And you’ll find love even though I leave, through the chronic pain and the misery
You’ll find lovers like you and me, you’ll find love like you and me

Pulling out all the stops. this train’s full-throttle lockеd
There’s no one еlse I’d rather have but
I’m good at self-sabotage, there’s no hopeful mirage
I complicate, you educate me

Though I think we were meant to be, we’d make it work far as I can see
You’ll find lovers like you and me, you’ll find lovers like you and me
And you’ll find love even though I leave, through the chronic pain and the misery
You’ll find lovers like you and me, you’ll find love like you and me

Well I will never be the same
Guess there’s not much to this game
Yeah I will never be the same

Anything You Want Lyrics

Trails of smoke trapped in a two by two
Wasting the night feels right when I'm with you
It’s the shimmer in your eyes
And the way you let down your disguise

I feel like I've known you for ages
I feel like with you I'm going places
Ah ah, ah ah

The same song on repeat
""You can call me anything you want""
It’s fine by me
Number two out of three
He says that it's his favorite
And I can't disagree


We talk about everything
The important and the mundane
You know I think you know everything
But the night's still young
And there's still so much to gain

Never Get Better Lyrics

You said you wanted
You said you wanted to be the one to inspire
Think you're the only one
You think you're the only one
There's just a million different reasons
And a million different ways
I'll make it out of here
I'll make it out of here, I swear

Is it too much?
Am I too late?
A feasible impossibility it seems
Is it too much?
Am I too late?
[Verse 2: Faiz Novascotia & 
Fathia Izzati
]
To stay awake at night
Slumber is just another hurdle
Invoke alone at night
But got a club ready to fight
And I wonder if you see it too
And I manage to think that I broke through

Is it too much?
Am I too late?
A feasible impossibility it seems
Is it too much?
Am I too late?
And will I be the one to shout or whisper?


And I'll never get better if you don't take me there (it's not enough just to show up here)
And I'll never get better if you don't seem to care (it's not enough just to be up here)
And I'll never get better if you don't take me there (it's not enough just to think it ain't fair)
And I'll never get better if you don't seem to care (it's not enough just to go anywhere)

A Sorrowful Reunion Lyrics

She wondered when the raindrops fell
She wondered why her cheeks were wet
And she entrusted a secret
That I could not have kept

I wonder where she is tonight
And wonder why the dawn was so bright
I couldn't contain it
Sank into the pavement

The sorrowful reunion
Was inevitable
Living an illusion, oh we were so compatible
And I miss all the X and Os
Do you regret the path you chose?

He looks as if he knows the way
So calm in his confliction
Though I know there's a storm here
Through his eyes I will hide my fear

I wonder why he's so composed
Though life seems to hand out troubles on a tray
Well I can't escape it
Hid down in the basement

[Verse 1: Fathia & 
Faiz
]
All the pieces are rearranging
Inside my mind, all the fucking time
Tiny whispers, but why are you shouting?
Is this yours or mine? I think it is a crime
[Verse 2: 
Faiz
 & Fathia]
Inside your pocket, dancing with the devil
Beyond my eyes you’ll see there’s no surprise
Flagrantly jumping to the nearest exit
You’ll find no relief, I turn the other cheek

And I don’t believe it’s true
When you say you want it too
[Verse 3: Fathia & 
Faiz
]
Brave enough to say it, brave enough to try it
Cleansing of the mind, a cleansing of the soul
Protagonist beliefs but antagonizing feelings
Mirrors in the sky reflect your hollow eyes

And I don’t believe it’s true
When you say you want it too
And I tore apart
An empty heart last night to find
Deep regret

[Verse 2: Faiz & Fathia] Inside your pocket, dancing with the devil Beyond my eyes you’ll see there’s no surprise Flagrantly jumping to the nearest exit You’ll find no relief, I turn the other cheek And I don’t believe it’s true When you say you want it too [Verse 3: Fathia & Faiz ] Protagonist beliefs but antagonizing feelings Mirrors in the sky reflect your hollow eyes And I don’t believe it’s true When you say you want it too And I tore apart An empty heart last night to find Deep regret And I don’t believe it’s true When you say you want it too And I tore apart An empty heart last night to find Deep regret"

Not Today Lyrics

Is it today? Is it tonight?
Is it tomorrow? I can't decide
We kiss the floor, we start a fight
There's nothing more, can't see the light

I wrote some art to antagonize
The earth's spinning to the other side
Oh what a time to be alive

Screen of lies, beautiful squares
Fall to demise, 
wish I was there
Sticks and leather yesterday was better
, and shooting games, they're not forever
Feels like a show I can't deny

They've all been waiting for thеir lives to start
While I've been longing for my еnding part
Oh what a time to be alive

The walls witness all my misery
As if I'm the one stuck in history
Am I the one that doesn't see?
Oh no, I was mistaken
This ain't the way, this ain't the way


It's not today, it's not tonight
There'll be tomorrow, you'll make it through the night
Get it together 'cause you know you'll find that the earth spins around for another time
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright
I know it's hard you can't understand the little things that could save a man
You take your plans and you make them true
You'll see your life in a different view",https://genius.com/Reality-club-not-today-lyrics,"Is it today? Is it tonight?

Love Epiphany Lyrics

Well
It goes like this
You find out you have similar interests
You use your finite sense of humor
To entertain her

But you're always wondering what she'll infer
Oh, such complex human nature

Oh, she's the best
You keep on sending her these hilarious image texts
Always on the hunt for what you should send next
Second-guessing and perplexed

Guess her attention's got you vexed
Worried you'll soon run out of jеst

But don't worry about it
We're just as cluelеss as the rest
We're all just looking to connect
With no idea of what happens next
Probably alone with nothing left


You love the way she makes you feel
You start to synchronize your meals
You compromise, you make some deals
Swapped excitement for some comfort
Back where you started

It's just the same old song and dance
A safety net or a love trance?

You make them witness promises
Bound by jewels, your happiness
Your love's just not like how it was, living with
These mini-monuments of your love
Blessings from up above

But her focus is not on you
And the love escapes you too

But don't worry about it
We're just as clueless as the rest
We're all just looking to connect
With no idea of what happens next
When you're alone, time to reflect


You can lose at any time
Talking bitter about some bullshit at Valentine's
But baby
Well, that's just the game
And maybe
You'll win just the same

And we'll find love
Through the ages as time goes by
In your teen years where love is shy
Love
In your twenties when it's raw
Flirty thirty, romance has thawed
Roaring forty, sparks has stopped
Nifty fifty, my sex drive drops
In the sixties I need you with me
Will you spend forever with me?

Am I Bothering You? Lyrics

We're both strangers to a miracle
We've had our eyes locked for a while
I've completed all the courses I need to understand my loneliness
I've accepted that maybe we're meant for a different time

But then out of the blue, a spark or two
Seems to generate

Now I'm bothering you, it's bothering me
What can I do? What should I do?
We're not too far, look where we arе
Bothering me, bothering you

Wе fill our days with hypotheticals (ooh ooh)
Living vividly in our minds (ooh ooh)
We take apart our dreams with heavy heart
But I know that maybe we can start something right

But then out of the blue, a spark or two
Seems to generate


Now I'm bothering you, it's bothering me
What can I do? What should I do?
We're not too far, look where we are
Bothering me, bothering you
Lost in the sea, feel so complete
Love is a myth, depends who you're with
Bothering me, bothering you
Ooo


But then out of the blue, a spark or two
Seems to generate
And you with similar views, you know my heart
Did incinerate

Now I'm bothering you, it's bothering me
What can I do? What should I do?
We're not too far, look where we are
Bothering me, bothering you
Lost in the sea, feel so complete
Love is a myth, depends who you're with
Bothering me, bothering you
Ooo hoo

I Wish I Was Your Joke Lyrics

Exercisin’ in the midnight zone
Under the twilight we will find a home
A roof and walls upon a starry sky we will reside
And sparks will fly

Start to talk and then your diction slips
Miss the punchline, you could use a script
You’re laughing at yourself and so is everybody else
Left in this place

Well the faster that you come
The sooner that you leave
I must be going down
‘Cause I can hardly breathe

I wish I was your joke
Passed around in sordid bars
When you can’t drive your car anymore
You’ll keep me in your back pocket
Use me then you’ll ignore it
I don’t mind


Use me once in May and then in June
Once a month, well I don’t mind that tune
Explore your expectations, baby, more is what you seek
And what you’ll find

Well the faster that you come
The sooner that you leave
I must be going down
‘Cause I can hardly breathe

I wish I was your joke
Passed around in sordid bars
When you can’t drive your car anymore
You’ll keep me in your back pocket
Use me then you’ll ignore it

I don’t mind at all, I’ll be your late night call
Wait for your heart to fall, I’m your lover boy, baby doll
Well this striking inclination, my desire for your affection’s got me
Sprung

Well the faster that you come
The sooner that you leave
I must be going down
‘Cause I can hardly breathe
You’ll keep me in your back pocket
Use me then you’ll ignore it

On My Own, Again Lyrics

As you walked down on my doorstep
I gotta make it clear
That I’m into you
Emotions rising, hope we kissin’
Oh now I’m on my own again

They say she paints with only red
I’d like to show her all the colors
They say she likes to stay in bed
Would it be better if we’re together
I'm looking for you silently, I know you’re not the kind of girl who stays
For long
I know too much of things unsaid, I wish I knew you when I had my wits
About

Again
On my own
Again

Disillusioned for the night
Wide awake while you’re asleep
I’m dancing without care
A pair of eyes you’ll never meet
‘Cause some might say the road to hell is paved
With good intentions
I’ve drawn the line that’s blurred with time but I won’t be the one to give you false
Pretentions


Again
On my own
Again
On my own

As you walked down on my doorstep
Gotta make it clear
That I’m into you
Emotions rising, hope we kissin’
Well now I’m on my own again
(One, two, three, four)
